    <p>A standard method for amide coupling was employed to prepare all bis-amide molecules in libraries 1 to 4. The reaction was carried out using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="2,500.88,475.69,3.24,5.83" target="#b5" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">6</ref> The HOBt/DIC-mediated amide coupling reaction was employed for all reactions due to the availability of the reagents and previous use within the research group with good yield. Additionally, most of the reactions were done with either dimethylformamide (DMF) or dichloromethane (DCM) as the solvent, because the urea by-product is soluble in DMF (easy to remove during washing) and the initial activation step is faster in nonpolar solvent like DCM.

    </p>
    <p>Every single reaction was checked by analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) performed on E. Merck silica gel-60 F254 layered plates (0.25 mm). TLC plates were visualized under UV light (254 or 360 nm) and/or by staining the plates with vanillin spray or potassium permanganate solution followed by heating.</p>
    <p>Compounds were purified by traditional column chromatography using Merck Flash Silica Gel-60 (230-400 mesh). To get an idea of a proper solvent system, traditional TLC was done using different solvent systems to get the best separation profile. Automated flash column chromatography is an air pressure-driven hybrid of medium pressure and short column chromatography, optimized for rapid separations on the basis of UV and ELSD detection. A Reveleris® Purification System was used to purify three compounds, where the mono-adduct and biadduct products' retention times (rf value) were very close to each other. Trituration process was used to purify crude chemical combinations with solid impurities. A solvent (either polar or non-polar) was selected in which the desired product was very soluble and the unwanted by-products were insoluble (or vice versa). The crude material was washed with the solvent and filtered away, leaving the purified product in solid form and any impurities in solution.</p>
    <p>The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technique was applied to monitor reaction progression and identification of the compounds. LC-MS was performed on a Waters Alliance 2695 with water and acetonitrile as the mobile phases. Formic acid (0.1%) was used with the acetonitrile to ensure acidic condition during the course of analysis. The gradient conditions were acetonitrile/water (95%) for 2 minutes which was increased to 50% acetonitrile over 3 minutes. The gradient was then held at 50% acetonitrile for one minute and then increased to 95% acetonitrile over 1.5 minutes. The quantity of acetonitrile was then returned to 5% over 1.5 minutes and held for 0.5 minutes. The total duration of each run was 5 and 10 minutes, which are described as A and B. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, 200 µL was split via a zero dead volume T-piece which passed into the mass spectrometer. The wavelength range of the UV detector was 220-400 nm. A diode array (535 scans) was functionalized with the system. A monolithic (C-18, 50X4.60 mm) column was used in the system.</p>
    <p>Proton NMR ( 1 H) and carbon NMR ( 13 C) were carried out on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrophotometer.</p>
    <p>Chemical shifts (δ H) are cited in ppm (parts per million) and referenced to deuterated chloroform (CDCl3, residual signal 1 H δ = 7.26, 13 C δ = 77.2), deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6, residual signal 1 H δ = 2.54, 13 C δ = 40.45), deuterated methanol (MeOD, residual methanol signal 1 H δ = 3.31, 13 C δ = 49.00). Multiplicities in 1 H NMR spectra are quoted as s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet q = quartet, m = multiplet, dd = doublet of doublets, ddd = doublet of doublet of doublets, dt = doublet of triplets, td = triplet of doublets, spt = septet and br = broad.</p>
    <p>The code (0) in 13 C NMR spectra denotes the presence of a quaternary carbon.</p>
    <p>High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a Thermo Navigator mass spectrometer coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) using electrospray ionisation (ES) and time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry.</p>
    <p>Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded on a Perkin Elmer spectrum 1000 instrument.</p>

    <div class="head">S3. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Assay</div>
    <p>Stabilization of DNA/RNA hybrid duplex structures upon addition of the ligand results in an increase of melting temperature of the ligand-bound oligonucleotide. The difference in melting temperatures gives idea about the stabilizing efficiency of the ligand to the DNA structure. A 'FRET melting assay' utilizes this basic principle where an increase in temperature leads to denaturing or melting of the macromolecule, causing the distance between the probes to increase and leading to an increase in fluorescent energy. The technique has been found to be very useful in investigating various types of nucleic acid structures. 11</p>
    <p>The synthesized molecules were screened against the telomeric DNA/RNA hybrid (DRH) duplex, a hairpin DNA/RNA hybrid duplex was used in this experiment where the DNA strand matched the exact human telomeric repeat sequence and RNA strand counterparts with the RNA template (red colour) of telomerase enzyme (a). cDD;</p>
    <p>Control DNA/DNA duplex -a hairpin form of oligonucleotide sequence was used in this experiment as a control for DRH, which is similar in orientation and base pairs to DRH with the exception of replacing the RNA bases with the corresponding DNA bases (b).

    <p>The fluorescence-tagged oligonucleotide sequences were diluted with sterile DEPC water (DNA Grade, Fisher Scientific) to obtain 20 µM solutions. 400 nM solutions prepared by serial dilution using FRET-buffer were annealed by heating at 85 °C for 5 minutes followed by cooling to room temperature over 3-4 hours (Grant Bio PCH-2 Dry Block Heating/Cooling System). For all ligands, 5 mM stock solutions were made with dimethyl sulfoxide (≥ 99.9 %, A.C.S. spectrophotometric grade, Sigma-Aldrich). From these stock solutions, 100 µM, 10 µM, 4 µM and 2 µM working solutions were prepared by serial dilutions with FRET buffer.</p>
    <p>For the FRET-based DNA melting assay, 50 µL of annealed DNA was added to each well of a 96-well plate (BioRad Laboratories), then 50 µL of ligand solution was added to each well. Three different concentrations (10 µM, 4 µM and 2 µM) of each compound were tested in triplicate. Most commonly, pure FRET buffer instead of ligand solution was added to all wells of the first line (A) of the plate to serve as a blank. After 15 minutes of incubation at room temperature, the plate was processed in a DNA Engine Opticon (Continuous Fluorescence Detector, MJ Research) and florescence measurements taken over a temperature range from 30-100 °C at intervals of 0.5 °C.</p>
    <p>Prior to each measurement, the temperature was kept constant for 30 seconds. The incident radiation was emitted at 450-495 nm and detection measured at 515-545 nm.</p>

    <div class="head">S4. Molecular Modelling Methodology for DNA/RNA Hybrid Duplex</div>
    <p>The DNA/RNA hybrid duplex was constructed by first using make-na (http://structure.usc.edu/makena/server.html) to create the RNA strand, followed by construction of the DNA sequence (including the TTT loop) using the AMBER module nab. The TTT loop was then covalently linked to the DNA backbone using parameters derived in-house. All compounds were docked in the minor groove of the DNA/RNA hybrid duplex sequence using AMBER xleap, parm99SB and modified parmbsc0 and Gaff AMBER force field parameters. Energy minimization was then undertaken in a gradient manner by initially placing the DNA or DNA/RNA hybrid duplex under a high force constraint (i.e. 500 kcal mol -1 Angstrom -2 ), which was reduced in stages to zero to enable the ligand to find its local energy minimum, followed by reduction in force in a periodic manner with a relaxation of restraints. Once in equilibrium, production simulations were run for a period of 10 ns, and atomic coordinates were saved at 1 ps intervals. Simulations involving the control DNA duplex were undertaken in an identical manner with the use of the AMBER module nuc to create the DNA sequence. Analysis of molecular dynamics simulations was undertaken using VMD

    <p>The fourteen selected molecules with good and moderate selectivity towards DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes (based on preliminary FRET results and molecular modelling studies) were screened against DRH (DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes), cDD (control DNA/DNA duplexes).</p>
    <p>Simultaneous UV absorption and CD spectra were acquired on Chirascan or Chirascan Plus spectrometers (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The instruments were flushed with pure nitrogen gas throughout the measurements. Far-UV spectra were recorded from 450 to 200 nm with a 1 nm spectral bandwidth, 0.5 nm stepsize and a 1 s spectrometer time-per-point. A rectangular 0.5 mm path length was employed. Unless otherwise stated, all spectra were measured at 25 °C (temperature controller made by Quantum NorthWest, Model-TC125). During data processing, a spectrum of the DNA media or solution was buffer-subtracted and Savitsky-Golay smoothing with a convolution width of 5 points applied. CD spectra were normalized for concentration and path length and expressed in terms of molar ellipticity per residue. Secondary structure analyses were performed using CDPro.</p>
    <p>50 mM Tris (Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) was prepared, adjusted to pH 7.4 with hydrochloric acid (1 N) and labelled as 50 mM 'Tris-HCl' buffer. The oligonucleotide sequences were diluted with sterile DEPC water (DNA Grade, Fisher Scientific) to obtain 100 µM solutions. 5 µM solutions of DNA were prepared by using CDbuffer (Tris-HCl buffer). The DNA solutions were stored in the freezer at -20 °C. For all tested compounds, 5 mM stock solutions were made with dimethyl sulfoxide (≥ 99.9 %, A.C.S. spectrophotometric grade, Sigma-Aldrich).</p>
    <p>From these stock solutions, 5 µM, 10 μM, 15 µM, 20 µM and 25 µM working solutions were prepared during experimentation with DNA solutions.</p>
    <p>For the CD-based DNA binding titration assay, 1,000 µL of respective buffer was first scanned and subsequently 1 μL of ligand was added into the same cuvette (filled with buffer) to scan one more time. Following the first step, the cuvette was cleaned properly and dried with an N2 flow. Afterwards, 1,000 μL of DNA solution were scanned to measure the appropriate wavelength for each type of DNA sequence. After determining the proper wavelength, 1 μL of ligand solution was added into the same cuvette to make a ligand concentration of 5 μM, which was then scanned again. Subsequently, an additional 1 μL of ligand solution was added into the cuvette to make the 10 to 25 µM ligand concentrations for each scanning. CD measurements were taken at 25 °C at a wavelength of 200-450 nm. </p>

    <div class="head">S7. Cytotoxicity Tests with the MTT Assay</div>
    <p>MTT assay was done to look for cytotoxic compounds by screening "hits" from initial high-throughput drug screening for cytotoxic effects. Cytotoxicity was monitored by using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT). A colorimetric reaction is used in this assay to measure the reducing potential of the cell. Viable cells will reduce the MTT reagent to a coloured formazan product. HeLa (Cervical cancer), MDA-MB-231 (Triple negative breast cancer) and NCI H1975 (Non-small cell lung cancer) cell lines were used in this assay, which were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).</p>
    <p>The MTT assay is comprised of a number of crucial steps, from cell splitting to 96-well plate reading in a photometer. The below steps were followed to process the MTT assay for each type of cell line:</p>
    <p>HeLa and MDA-MB231 cell lines were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and streptomycin and 1% NEAA (200x) non-essential amino acids. NCI H1975 cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Three cells were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.</p>
    <p>Cells were passed when they are 70-80% confluent. In this process, a small number of confluent cells are transferred into a new vessel since a high density of rapidly dividing cells is related to cells going into senescence.</p>
    <p>Cells contained in a T-flask were taken out from the incubator and checked under a microscope (dead cells floated and appeared round-shaped, whereas growing cells were attached to the bottom surface in a rod-shaped and clustered fashion). Previous media was aspirated by using a vacuum pump (a sharp pointed pipette, 2 mL, was used for this purpose). 5 mL of DPBS was added to wash previous media fully and clean the T-flask, which was aspirated again to remove the floating dead cells as well. 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA was added to detach the growing cells and the flask was then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2 minutes. 10 mL of DMEM was added to inactivate the trypsin; afterwards the total suspension was transferred into a falcon tube for centrifugation (2.5 minutes, 21 °C, 1.5 rpm). All the supernatant medium was aspirated out, leaving the cells at the bottom of the tube. Finally, 5 mL of DMEM was added and mixed properly and an appropriate amount of cell suspension transferred to a newly-labelled T-flask according to next passage time. Furthermore, an appropriate amount of DMEM was added into the same T-flask to make a total volume of 15 mL (in general, 15 mL is the optimum volume for the survival of cells in a T-flask). Lastly, the new T-flask was returned to the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for the next splitting schedule. Cells were passaged every 2 to 3 days. 70% ethanol was used to clean the fume hood, equipment, flask and pipette before starting any process.</p>
    <p>In our experiments, 96-well polypropylene plates were used to seed cells and carry out the MTT experiments with tested compounds which are free of binding affinity for proteins or DNA, allowing complete sample recovery.</p>
    <p>These plates can withstand temperatures of -80 to +121°C. A haemocytometer was used to count cells, where a solution of cells was made with typan blue stain (10 μL cells/90 μL stain) to visualize the cells under an electron</p>
    <p>microscope. An appropriate amount of cell suspension was taken to make a dilution of cells with DMEM to confirm about 10 6 cells per well. Afterwards, a multichannel pipette was used to seed cells on to the plate, which was then returned for incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator (incubation time was varied from 24 -72 hours).</p>
    <p>During the addition of test compounds, the previous medium was aspirated out from every well by using sharp pipette tips and replaced with an equal amount (100 μL) of fresh medium and ligand of appropriate concentration, made from a 5 mM stock solution by using DMSO, which were then added onto the cell seeded plate. Lastly, the plate was returned for further incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator (incubation time was 72 hours).</p>
    <p>After incubation of 72 hours, plates were processed to read and assay the data. Firstly, old medium was aspirated off from each well after the predetermined incubation period and subsequently each well was washed with 100 μL of medium (high glucose content but without phenol red). Then all medium was aspirated off from each well and 100 μL of previously made MTT/medium phenol red-free solution was added into each well. A further 4 hours of incubation was done at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator and afterwards medium was aspirated off from each well and 100 μL of DMSO was added to dissolve the crystals formed. The plate was again incubated for 5 minutes at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator and subsequently placed in a shaker for 5 minutes (500 rpm) to remove all air bubbles. Absorbance were then taken by an Infinite 200Pro plate reader at a 570 nm wavelength and the data was processed with the help of Tecan i-control application software.</p>
    <p>Of note, MTT solution was prepared in a 1:10 dilution with phenol red-free medium; e.g., 1 mL of MTT was added into 9 mL of phenol red-free medium. The final solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and kept in the dark at 4°C. Such solutions can be stored for up to a month.</p>
