  <div class="profileDesc"> A one-pot, two-step, total synthesis of naturally occurring xenortides A, B, C and D, (Xens AD) isolated from the bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila, and an entire complementary set of stereoisomers, has been achieved. Compounds were synthesized utilizing an isocyanide-based Ugi 4-CR followed by facile N-Boc deprotection. The reaction sequence took advantage of the chiral pool of N-Boc protected amino acids (L-Leu/Val and D-Leu/Val) with aryl isocyanides, phenyl acetaldehyde and methylamine giving the desired Xens AD (A and B &gt;98% ee) and all subsequent stereoisomers in reasonable yields upon de-protection followed by separation of diastereomers. Also, detailed mechanistic insights for diastereo-selectivity of (−)-Xen A, as a model in the Ugi 4-CR, has been described. Moreover, for the first time, this focused library was screened for cytotoxicity against a panel of epithelial cancer cell lines as well as normal cell lines with an MTT proliferation assay. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) study demonstrated that tryptamides Xen B and D were more active than phenylethylamides Xen A and C. Furthermore, (−)-Xen B (IC 50 = 19-25 µM) and ent-(+)-Xen D (IC 50 = 21-26 µM) gave the highest cyto-toxicity and they were also found to be non-toxic toward normal cells. Importantly, the SAR results indicate that the stereochemistry at C 8 and C 11 in (−)-Xen B and ent-(+)-Xen D play a critical role in cytotoxic activity. </div>

    <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015.

Multidrug resistance, lack of selective chemotherapeutic drugs against target tumor cells and severe side effects are major limitations for the availability of anticancer agents.

Here within, we document our synthetic strategy to Xens A-D including all possible stereoisomers. Furthermore, we demonstrate compound bio-potential by examining anticancer activity of each isomer in several epithelial cancer cells. Moreover, this study represents the first anticancer activity report on the Xen family.
    </p>
    <p>Recently, the synthesis of (−)-Xen D was reported by Reimer et al. 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="2,62.53,408.59,7.02,5.74" target="#b24" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">14</ref> (−)-Xen D was synthesized via standard peptide coupling reaction conditions using several expensive peptide coupling reagents and multi-step syntheses giving rise to several purification procedures. Furthermore, the aforementioned strategy would not be easily accessible to a small library of derivatives as further synthetic manipulations would be required. These limitations encouraged us to devise a streamlined chemical route toward the synthesis of highly enantiopure Xens. To the best of our knowledge, there are no literature reports describing the synthesis of the complete set of Xen natural products and their ent/epi-stereoisomers. Moreover, we believe that the synthesis of highly enantiopure natural Xens A-D and their related stereoisomers may shed light on how the stereochemical properties of chiral, non-racemic Xens play out in anticancer studies, which have never been previously attempted. In the context of developing simple structural manipulations of the starting materials and atom-economical synthetic routes for the synthesis of Xens and all their stereoisomers, we designed an efficient and effective synthetic strategy employing an Ugi four component reaction (4-CR) process.

As such, this approach is highly efficient, allowing for xenortide library development with every possible stereochemical combination, which is standard for SAR studies, following the mantra of medicinal and biological chemistry. Our retrosynthetic analysis for those compounds is shown in Scheme 1.

Formylation was achieved via refluxing the aryl ethylamine (1a′ and 1b′) with ethyl formate for 6 h. A solution of the related aryl ethyl formate (1a″ and 1b″) and Et 3 N in anhydrous dichloromethane was treated with POCl 3 at −78 °C for 3 h to furnish the required isocyanides in nearly quantitative yields (Scheme 2).
    </p>
    <p>Having precursors 1a and 1b in hand, we began our twostep synthetic protocol of (−)-Xen A (5) and epi-(+)-Xen A (5a) (Scheme 3). The reaction was designed to employ stoichiometric equivalents of phenylethyl isocyanide (1a), phenyl acetaldehyde (2), methylamine (3) (33% weight in ethanol) and Boc-N-methyl-L-leucine (4a) which readily dissolved in methanol as the solvent. The reaction was then stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The resultant mixture led to the formation of Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic approach to naturally occurring Xens A-D using an Ugi 4-CR (1(a,b) + 2 + 3 + 4(a,b)).</p>

However, due to the formation of rotamers during 1 H NMR analysis, we were unable to quantitate the actual diastereomeric ratios of the unpurified mixture of 5′ and 5a′. We have performed NMR studies at high temperature in an attempt to clarify the rotameric issue, however, complete coalescence was not achieved. After careful separation of the Boc protected diastereomers using silica gel column chromatography with hexane and ethyl acetate as the eluents, 1 H NMR analysis was conducted for individual diastereomers 5′ and 5a′. Unfortunately, rotamers were once again problematic and definitive NMR characterization continued to be elusive. Compounds 5′ and 5a′ were then subjected to Boc deprotection using 50% TFA in DCM at 0 °C for 2 h (Scheme 4). After TLC indicated complete Boc deprotection, isolation and purification of the individual (−)-Xen A (5) and epi-(+)-Xen A (5a) ensued using heptane and ethyl acetate as the solvents with normal phase silica gel chromatography. Pure compounds were then subjected to 1 H NMR spectral analysis and at this point we did not observe rotamers, which had plagued our ability to properly characterize other intermediates as previously stated. All of the NMR spectral analysis and the optical rotary values observed for compounds 5 and 5a gave identical peak matching to previous literature reports.

    </p>
    <p>To further support a more efficient and effective process to Xens A-D, the strategy was intended to avoid tedious workup and purifications of Boc-protected compounds such as 5′ and 5a′.</p>
    <p>In formalizing the one-pot, two-step synthetic process for (−)-Xen A (5) and epi-(+)-Xen A (5a) (Scheme 4), we decided to follow the exact route for the synthesis of the other Xen family of natural products. Therefore, in all cases, when TLC and mass spectral analysis indicated completion, methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure and without any further purification, the crude mixture was subjected to the Boc deprotection conditions which consisted of 50% TFA in DCM at 0 °C followed by stirring for 2 h.</p>
    <p>The unpurified mixture of (+/−)-Xens A-D was then analyzed using 1 H NMR to determine diastereomeric ratios and then silica gel column chromatography with heptane and ethyl acetate as the solvent system was used to isolate our target molecules. Further NMR spectral analysis of the individually isolated pure compounds was conducted and peak shift values were observed matching exactly to those found in the literature.

Reactions were subjected to conditions at 0 °C, room temperature and 40 °C all the while maintaining consistency with a 24 h reaction time-frame using methanol as the solvent. From these studies, we observed that room temperature conditions gave the best diastereomeric ratios of 1.5 : 1 when compounds 1a, 2, 3, 4a were used 
     <ref type="table" coords="3,462.67,338.55,33.60,8.60" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Table 1)</ref>.

    <p>All the other natural Xens and their stereoisomers were obtained employing the conditions noted in entry 2; 
     <ref type="table" coords="3,520.50,362.53,28.67,8.60" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 1</ref>. Using the noted conditions enabled us to access a small library of Xen derivatives with isocyanides 1a and 1b along with L-Leu and L-Val. Diastereomeric ratios were again determined using 1H NMR and R f values of each diastereomer in heptane/ethyl acetate (4 : 1) were noted as documented in

    </p>
    <p>In all cases, formation of diastereomers with (S) configuration at C 8 were favored over those with the (R) configuration (Scheme 5).

In this mechanism, we propose that nucleophilic attack by the phenylethyl isocyanide (1a) occurs from the Reface of the thermodynamically more stable (E)-imine, which forms first in the equilibrium sequence of events between 2 and 3 (I). We argue that this is made possible through hydrogen-bond donation of amino acids 4a-4d, which block the Siface of the (E)-imine and leads to the slightly preferred (S) configuration at C 8 (II). What follows next is attack on the nitrilium ion by the carboxylate leading to intermediate (III) which undergoes the Mumm rearrangement

    </p>
    <p>Under the conditions noted, all desired target products were obtained in fair to moderate yields. We were able to calculate the enantioselectivities for (−)-Xen A/B and ent-(+)-Xen A/B using specific optical rotation values of those compounds reported in literature 2 (

The excellent optical rotary values observed between our compounds and those published reveal that retention of chirality is maintained in the N-Boc protected amino acids (L/D-Leu) under our protocol. This further validates that under our noted reaction conditions no racemization at C 11 occurred.

    <p>The influence of chirality at C 8 and C 11 on cytotoxicity of naturally occurring Xens A-D and all their stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers) were investigated and some interesting results were observed from this focused library of compounds. Tryptamides Xen B and D stereoisomers were overall more active than the phenylethylamides Xen A and C stereoisomers. It was also previously reported that tryptamides (−)-Xen B and D, natural products were more active than natural phenylethylamides (−)-Xen A and C against sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense) and malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) diseases. 14 These data together suggest that tryptamide analogues play a significant role in the enhancement of biological activity of the Xen family. In addition, (−)-Xen B and ent-(+)-Xen D were found to be most active among all tested compounds. (−)-Xen B at 19-25 µM produced significant morphological changes against a total of five tested cancer cell lines, HCT-116, H460, OV-2008, MDA-MB-23, DU-145 (

Also, ent-(+)-Xen D had a 21-26 µM cytotoxicity, selective against three tested cancer cell lines that included HCT-116, OV-2008 and MDA-MB-23. Moreover, inspecting the cytotoxicity of active compounds ((−)-Xen B and ent-(+)-Xen D), in comparison to their related stereoisomers, revealed that although they have the same chemical structures, they exhibit distinct differences in anticancer activities. For example, natural (−)-Xen B in comparison to its enantiomer, ent-(+)-Xen B, revealed markedly more cytotoxic activity (IC 50 = 19-25 µM) than its enantiomer (IC 50 = 41-100 µM) in all evaluated cancer lines. Similarly, ent-(+)-Xen D exhibited significantly higher cytotoxic activity than its enantiomer (−)-Xen D, with IC 50 values of 21-50 µM and &gt;100 µM, respectively. Furthermore, in this study, the potency of the most active compounds was considerably greater for cancer cells when compared to the normal cells, meaning that no toxicity was recorded toward normal cell lines CRL-1459 and CHO. (These compounds were noted to be considerably safe when tested on the normal cell lines.)

Cisplatin, a well-known anticancer agent, was used as a positive control in our experiments. We observed that although, cisplatin killed the cancer cells at a concentration range of 8-14 µM, they were less selective compared to Xens on normal cells

Based on our data, for (−)-Xen B and the cohort of stereoisomers, the chiral properties of C 8 containing the (S) stereoconfiguration is considered a critical factor influencing compound potency. As summarized in

    <div class="head">Conclusion</div>
    <p>In conclusion, a concise synthesis of natural Xens A-D and all subsequent stereoisomers has been achieved in a one-pot, twostep Ugi 4-CR synthetic strategy. In this reaction, chiral N-Boc protected amino acids (L-Leu/Val and D-Leu/Val), aryl isocyanides, phenyl acetaldehyde and methylamine were utilized as starting materials. All reactions were carried out efficiently and simple chromatographic purification led to enantiomeric excesses (&gt;90% ee) in reasonable yields. Based on our knowledge of the literature, the anticancer activities of sixteen Xen family of natural products and all their subsequent stereoisomers are reported here for the very first time. When dealing with biological interactions especially for medicinal applications, comparing the activity of stereoisomers is crucial, as biological targets are chiral. The stereo-SAR study demonstrated that only two compounds, among sixteen synthesized, were very active in the MTT assay. Natural (−)-Xen B revealed high cytotoxic activity against five tested cancer cell lines and ent-(+)-Xen D indicated decent cytotoxicity/selectivity against three cancer cell lines, described in 
     <ref type="table" coords="6,447.43,542.53,27.99,8.60" target="#tab_2" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Table 4</ref>. Furthermore, SAR results indicated that the stereochemistry at C 8 and C 11 in (−)-Xen B and ent-(+)-Xen D, respectively, plays an important role in cytotoxic activities. Moreover, it should be noted that most of the compounds, especially those that are considerably active, were significantly less toxic toward normal cells, when compared to cancer cells, suggesting that the Xen analogues show selective toxicity. Cisplatin, a well-known anticancer agent, was used as a positive control in our experiments and Xen were more selective compared to cisplatin on normal cells. Finally, the results suggest that the stereochemistry of Xens could possibly play a vital role in the enhancement of bioactivity. Therefore, finding the target binding site should reveal more information about the connection between chiral properties and bioactivity of Xens in the future.

    <p>Chemistry. All reagents and solvents purchased were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Reaction progress was monitored using thin layer chromatography (TLC). TLC was visualized using UV. Column chromatography was performed using Whatman Purasil 60 A (230-400 mesh ASTM) silica gel; yields refer to chromatographically and spectroscopically pure compounds. 1 H and 13 C NMR were recorded using a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer at 22 °C (default) unless otherwise noted. The residual solvent signal in CD 3 OD was referenced to 3.31 and 49.0 ppm in proton and carbon spectra respectively. Signal patterns are indicated as s: singlet; d: doublet; t: triplet; q: quartet; m: multiplet; dd: doublet of doublets; br: broad and coupling constants are reported in hertz (Hz). Low resolution mass spectra (LRMS) were acquired on an Esquire-LC electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometer. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained with a Bruker Maxis 4G mass spectrometer.</p>
    <p>General procedure. To 0.27 mL (1.66 mmol) of methylamine (33% in ethanol) (3) in 15 mL methanol, was added 0.18 mL (1.66 mmol) phenyl acetaldehyde 
     <ref type="formula" coords="7,185.84,314.51,9.54,8.60" target="#formula_3" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(2)</ref>, and the reaction was allowed to stir for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then, 1.66 mmol of corresponding carboxylic acid 4a-b, and 1.66 mmol of isocyanide 1a-b were added sequentially and the reaction was continuously stirred until no noticeable starting reagents were visualized on TLC. Upon completion of the reaction, methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure. After obtaining mass of the unpurified Boc-protected product, the material was dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 (1 mL) and trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added as the reaction mixture was allowed to chill in an ice-bath for 2 h. The reaction was monitored for completion by TLC and the contents were then concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude compound was then subjected to flash column chromatography (EtOAc/hexanes) to yield pure compounds 5-8(a-c).

    <p>To determine the cytotoxicity of the natural Xens A-D and all stereoisomers thereof, a (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) MTT colorimetric assay was used, as previously described. 
     <ref type="bibr" coords="10,127.33,100.64,7.02,5.74" target="#b47" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">37</ref> Briefly, after harvesting the cells with 0.25% trypsin and 2.21 mM EDTA, 1×, cancer cell lines were re-suspended in DMEM. Cells were seeded evenly (180 µl per well) into 96 well-plates in triplicate at 5000 cells per well and the plates were returned to the incubator, allowing cells to attach to the wells, for up to 24 h. On the second day of the experiment, various concentrations of each compound ranging from 0.10 to 100.0 µM (20.0 µL per well) were added to the wells. After 72 h of incubation, 20.0 µL of the MTT solution (4.0 mg mL −1 ) was added to each well. The plates were further incubated for 4 h to allow the viable cells to bio transform the yellow-colored MTT into dark-blue formazan crystals. The medium was discarded and 100.0 µL of DMSO was used to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using the SpectraMax® iD3 H1 Multi-Mode Micro Reader from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The IC 50 values were calculated from the cell survival percentages. Similarly, the cytotoxicity of the test compounds was compared to normal cell lines CHO and CRL-1459.

Coincident results were observed for ent-epi-(−)-Xen B and ent-(+)-Xen B, with IC 50 values of 20-60 µM and 41 → 100 µM, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the chirality at C 8 plays a substan- tial role in cytotoxic activity of (−)-Xen B stereoisomers. Moreover, ent-(+)-Xen D (highlighted in yellow) was selec- tively active against three cancer cell lines, including HCT-116, MDA-MB-231 and OV-2008. In those three cancer cell lines, ent-(+)-Xen D with (R) configuration at C 11 revealed better cyto- toxic effects than its diastereomer, epi-(+)-Xen D, with respect- ive IC 50 values of 21-35 µM and 49 → 79 µM. Similar results were observed for ent-epi-(−)-Xen D and (−)-Xen D, proving that the stereochemistry of C 11 in (−)-Xen D plays an important role in cytotoxic activity.</div>
