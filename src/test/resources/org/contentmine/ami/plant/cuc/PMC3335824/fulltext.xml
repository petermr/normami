Our previous analyses were unable to detect any alteration in the accumulation of DCL2 or DCL3-specific sRNAs, or the expression of their respective target genes in any <italic>drb</italic> mutant plant line assessed <xref rid="pone.0035933-Curtin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This suggested that DRB2, DRB3 and DRB5 are not involved in sRNA biogenesis or target gene expression regulation.

Molecular analyses revealed a clear association between the loss of DRB2 activity and the altered accumulation of both the elevated and reduced miRNA classes. This shows that DRB2 is both antagonistic and synergistic to DRB1 in miRNA biogenesis in this developmentally important tissue. We further demonstrate, through complementation of the <italic>drb1</italic> mutant by constitutively over-expressing a <italic>DRB2</italic> transgene that the involvement of DRB2 in miRNA biogenesis is restricted by its tissue-specific expression in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DRB family member expression and mutant phenotypes</title><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miRNAs typically require the DCL1/DRB1 protein complex for their biogenesis <xref rid="pone.0035933-Reinhart1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035933-Rajagopalan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

As described for the <italic>drb1</italic> plant line with reduced miRNA accumulation, the <italic>drb235</italic> triple mutant also expresses a pleiotropic phenotype. Although the margins of <italic>drb235</italic> rosette leaves remain serrated, they do not display the dark-green coloration and ovular shape of <italic>drb2</italic> rosette leaves. Instead, they are pale green in color with dark green venation of the vasculature, have a lanceolate shape and are downturned at their tips (epinasty). Furthermore, the petioles of <italic>drb235</italic> rosette leaves are markedly shorter than those of wild-type plants, and this combined with their downward curvature leads to the formation of a compact rosette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to all other single, double or triple <italic>drb</italic> mutant plants, which essentially display the architecture of a wild-type inflorescence stem, the stems of <italic>drb235</italic> plants are fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with its role as a cofactor for DCL1 in miRNA biogenesis, <italic>DRB1</italic>pro:GUS plants showed constitutive and ubiquitous reporter gene expression.

Analysis of plants transformed with our original <italic>DRB2</italic>pro:GUS vector, containing a 1.7 kb putative promoter fragment, suggested that; i) <italic>DRB2</italic> expression was restricted to developing anthers, pollen and germinating seed, and; ii) <italic>DRB2</italic> expression did not overlap with <italic>DRB3</italic> and <italic>DRB5</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0035933-Curtin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, extending the putative promoter region to include 4 kb upstream of the transcription start site of <italic>DRB2</italic> showed that in vegetative tissue <italic>DRB2</italic> expression is concentrated in the SAM region, an expression domain that overlaps with <italic>DRB3</italic> and <italic>DRB5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>miRNA accumulation in the SAM region of <italic>drb235</italic> plants</title><p>The developmental phenotypes expressed by <italic>drb1</italic> and <italic>drb235</italic> plants, in addition to the overlapping expression of <italic>DRB2</italic>, <italic>DRB3</italic> and <italic>DRB5</italic> led us to investigate miRNA accumulation in whole plant samples for comparison to the specific tissues where these three DRB family members are expressed.

Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses of amiR-PDS accumulation, precursor transcript processing and target transcript expression demonstrated that the differences in silencing efficiencies directed by either amiRNA vector in Col-0 and <italic>drb1</italic> plants was a result of inefficient precursor transcript processing in the absence of DRB1 activity, leading to reduced mature amiR-PDS accumulation and defective silencing of the <italic>PDS</italic> target gene in <italic>drb1</italic> transformant lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g005">Figures 5B and 5D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0035933-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0035933.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Artificial miRNA-directed silencing of <italic>PDS</italic>.</title><p>(A) Photo-bleached phenotypes expressed by Col-0 and <italic>drb</italic> mutants transformed with the amiR<sup>164B</sup>-PDS plant expression vector.

Fusion of the DRB2 coding sequence to the YFP reporter gene showed that DRB2 is a nuclear protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). DCL1 and DRB1 are also nuclear-localized and function in concert in D-bodies to direct cleavage of miRNA/miRNA&#x0002a; duplexes in a sequential two-step process from the dsRNA stem-loop regions of pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA transcripts <xref rid="pone.0035933-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035933-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0035933-Hiraguri1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> providing further support for the requirement of DRB2 activity in the biogenesis of a subset of miRNAs in specific tissues. It has recently been reported that DRB2 is antagonistic to DRB4 in the production of all siRNA size classes processed from PolIV generated transcripts and that DRB2 is synergistic to DRB4 in the biogenesis of DCL4-dependent miRNAs <xref rid="pone.0035933-Plissier1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These findings parallel those reported here on DRB2 antagonism and synergism in DCL1/DRB1-directed miRNA biogenesis and suggest that the dsRNA intermediates derived from PolIV generated transcripts, or the stem-loop structures of DCL4/DRB4-dependent miRNA precursor transcripts also express structural features or sequence motifs that direct their interaction with DRB2 as well as with DRB4. Alternatively, DRB2 could be competing with DRB1 and DRB4 for interaction with their partnering proteins DCL1 and DCL4. Taken together, the results presented here and those of <xref rid="pone.0035933-Plissier1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> suggest that DCL/DRB partnerships and/or DRB dsRNA interactions in the endogenous sRNA biogenesis pathways of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are more complex than previously thought.</p><p>As suggested by our northern blotting data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g005">5D</xref>), DRB3 are DRB5 play no role in the processing steps of miRNA biogenesis and the constitutive and ubiquitous expression of these two DRB proteins failed to compensate for the loss of DRB1 activity in <italic>drb1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g006">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>). YFP fusion to the DRB3 and DRB5 coding sequences revealed that they are not able to compensate for the loss of nuclear-localized DRB1 activity as they are both expressed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). However, these two cytoplasmic DRBs do appear to be involved in regulating the expression of specific target genes of DRB2-associated miRNAs. For example, the combined loss of DRB3 and DRB5 activity was demonstrated to result in the complete repression of <italic>CUC2</italic> expression in the SAM region of <italic>drb235</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the almost complete absence of photo-bleaching in <italic>drb235</italic>/amiR<sup>169A</sup>-PDS transformants compared to the tissue-specific loss of amiR<sup>169A</sup>-PDS-directed silencing only in <italic>drb2</italic>/amiR<sup>169A</sup>-PDS plants suggests that the activity of all three of these closely-related DRB family members is required for wild-type expression regulation of DRB2-associated miRNA target genes. The exact role that these two cytoplasmically-localized DRBs play in miRNA biogenesis or action remains to be functionally characterized.</p><p>We propose that, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, DRB2 is performing a dual regulatory role in miRNA biogenesis in specific tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g007">Figure 7</xref>). MiRNAs with wild-type accumulation in <italic>drb235</italic> plants are produced by the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway mediated by the DCL1/DRB1 partnership (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g007">Figure 7</xref>; upper middle dark grey panel). Following their export to the cytoplasm the DCL1/DRB1-generated miRNA is loaded onto AGO1-catalyzed RISC to guide silencing of cognate mRNAs. For miRNAs with elevated accumulation in <italic>drb235</italic> plants our results suggest that their precursor transcripts harbor structural features or sequence motifs that direct their interaction with DRB2. For DRB2 to direct its antagonistic effect on the DCL1/DRB1 biogenesis pathway, the DRB2-associating signal is predicted to be positioned within the pri-miRNA sequence that would prevent pre-miRNA stem-loop formation. In the event that the DRB2-associating signal was positioned outside of this region, the pri-miRNA would still have the capacity to fold and be recognized for entry into the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g007">Figure 7</xref>; upper left light grey panel). DRB2 is also synergistic to DRB1 for the biogenesis of another distinct class of miRNAs. The precursor transcripts of miRNAs with reduced accumulation in <italic>drb235</italic> plants express associating signals that could direct their interaction with either DRB1 or DRB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035933-g007">Figure 7</xref>; upper right light grey panel). Directing different DRB/pri-miRNA transcript associations in tissues where <italic>DRB2</italic> is expressed would not only add an additional layer of regulatory complexity to miRNA-mediated target gene expression, but would also ensure the viability of plants in which either DRB1 or DRB2 activity is temporarily suppressed, for example by some environmental or pathogen-mediated stress.</p><fig id="pone-0035933-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0035933.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Proposed model for an alternate tissue-specific miRNA biogenesis pathway.</title><p>In the SAM region, the established DCL1/DRB1 functional partnership is responsible for the biogenesis of miRNAs with unchanged accumulation in <italic>drb235</italic> plants (upper middle dark grey panel).
