A recent model to explain pattern formation along the mediolateral axis hypothesizes that <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity and <italic>BP</italic>/<italic>RPL</italic> function as antagonistic lateral and medial factors, respectively, which tend to repress each other. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of mutual exclusion mechanisms between both kinds of factors, and how this determines the formation and size of the three territories.

Two of them, the valves and the valve margins, are placed in lateral positions, while the third, called replum, is located in the medial plane of the flower. The replum expresses meristematic genes (medial factors) that specify its development, whereas the function of genes that work in leaves (lateral factors) determines the development of valves and valve margins. Consequently, medial and lateral pattern elements of fruits apparently mimic the antagonistic relationships between meristem and leaves. According to this, we propose a model for mediolateral patterning of fruits whereby the mutual opposing activities of medial and lateral factors drive the formation of replum, valves, and valve margins. We conclude that medial factors function in an autonomous fashion to prevent the expression of lateral factors in the replum, and that lateral factors repress medial factors by a non-autonomous mechanism to allow normal replum development. Our model provides explanation for changes in fruit shape in Brassicaceae and related organisms either by mutation within a species or by natural variation among different species.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>JJR was recipient of a fellowship from the program &#x0201c;Postdoctoral Fellowships of Excellence&#x0201d; of the Generalitat Valenciana.

Subsequently, polarity is determined along the main axes of symmetry giving rise to pattern elements with specific tissue types. Thus, for instance, along the apical-basal axis both pistils and fruits show, from bottom to top, the basal gynophore, the ovary, the style and the apical stigma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003020-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1003020-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003020.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Main pattern elements along the mediolateral axis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild-type fruit.</title><p>Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrograph of a stage 17 fruit artificially colored to highlight the main pattern elements along the mediolateral axis: valves in green, replum in blue and valve margins in purple (A) and a higher magnification of the same fruit (B).

The replum, located at the medial plane of the flower, is a narrow structure that separates two lateral valves. At the valve-replum boundary, the valve margin, another lateral tissue, comprises a few rows of small and rounded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003020-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;1C</xref>).

In this report, we demonstrate that, indeed, both medial and lateral factors are mutually antagonistic, as they repress each other. We have observed that lateral factors negatively regulate in a non-autonomous fashion <italic>BP</italic>, thus restricting the size of the medial region, an essential condition for proper replum development, whereas medial factors limit in an autonomous way the expression of <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity genes, whose products only are detected outside the replum. Furthermore, we have also found that <italic>AS1</italic> collaborates with lateral factors by preventing downregulation of <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity genes by the ectopic expression of <italic>BP</italic> in lateral regions. Here, we propose a non-overlapping model whereby the opposing activities of medial and lateral factors determine the specification and size of pattern elements along the mediolateral axis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> fruit. In accordance with this model, an increase in the expression of medial factors and a decrease in lateral factor activities lead to the overproduction of medial tissues along with a large reduction in the size of the lateral domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>
<italic>BP</italic> is involved in the replum defects of mutants with impaired <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that the MYB transcription factor AS1 regulates patterning along the mediolateral axis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> fruit.

This phenotype is accompanied with a reduction in the final size of the valves as the valve epidermal layer contains fewer cells <xref rid="pgen.1003020-AlonsoCantabrana1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

<xref rid="pgen.1003020-AlonsoCantabrana1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Interestingly two members of this activity, the YAB1 group genes <italic>FIL</italic> and <italic>YAB3</italic>, have been previously described to repress <italic>BP</italic> in leaves <xref rid="pgen.1003020-Kumaran1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. But so far no evidence indicates that this control also occurs in fruits. We therefore analyzed the expression of the <italic>BP::GUS</italic> reporter construct in mutant backgrounds affected in <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity. In wild-type ovaries, <italic>BP::GUS</italic> expression is primarily detected in the medial region, corresponding to the replum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003020-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003020-AlonsoCantabrana1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003020-Ragni1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. When the <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity was compromised, we observed that the intensity of the <italic>BP::GUS</italic> signal increased and its expression domain expanded, achieving the widest domain in the <italic>fil yab3 jag</italic> triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003020-g003">Figure 3B&#x02013;3F</xref>). The exception was the <italic>yab3</italic> single mutant, in which the behavior of the <italic>BP::GUS</italic> reporter was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (data not shown). Nevertheless, we observed by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) a significant increase in the expression levels of <italic>BP</italic> transcripts in the pistils of all backgrounds affected in <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity, including <italic>yab3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003020-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Therefore, these results and those shown in the previous section indicate that the <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity, functioning in valves and valve margins, negatively regulates <italic>BP</italic> expression in medial domains and that this repression is required for the correct specification of the replum.</p><fig id="pgen-1003020-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003020.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The Expression of <italic>BP</italic> increases in mutants with impaired <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity.</title><p>(A&#x02013;F) Cross-sections of stage 15 fruits showing the expression of the <italic>BP::GUS</italic> reporter in the wild type (A), <italic>jag-1</italic> (B), <italic>fil-8</italic> (C), <italic>fil-8 jag-1</italic> (D), <italic>fil-8 yab3-2</italic> (E), and <italic>fil-8 yab3-2 jag-1</italic> (F).

Contrary to this line of reasoning, the GUS signal in repla of such mutants is not only wider than that of wild type but also more intense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003020-g003">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that the increase in replum width is not the only cause of the higher levels of <italic>BP</italic> expression in mutant pistils. To further address this issue, we tested, by qRT-PCR, the expression levels of another replum gene, <italic>RPL</italic>, in multiple genetic conditions with impaired <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity and lacking <italic>BP</italic> function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003020.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

Levels of <italic>RPL</italic> transcripts in wild-type and <italic>bp</italic> pistils were quite similar, indicating that loss of <italic>BP</italic> function has little effect on <italic>RPL</italic> expression. However, in pistils of <italic>fil yab3 bp</italic> and <italic>fil jag bp</italic>, <italic>RPL</italic> expression was significantly higher than in those of both the wild type and the <italic>bp</italic> mutant, despite the moderate width of the repla in the two triple mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003020.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, enhanced expression of <italic>RPL</italic>, and most likely of <italic>BP</italic>, in such mutant backgrounds does not exclusively depend on replum size, supporting again the negative regulation of <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity on replum genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>

</title><p>Besides their activities in fruit patterning, <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity genes have been previously described by their participation in the formation of other lateral organs. Consequently, they all are expressed in lateral organs but not in meristematic tissues.

Nevertheless, although <italic>FIL</italic> and <italic>YAB3</italic> are not expressed in meristems, by means of a non-cell-autonomous mechanism, they contribute to shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance by negatively regulating <italic>WUSCHEL</italic> (<italic>WUS</italic>) and <italic>CLAVATA3</italic> (<italic>CLV3</italic>) genes, both expressed at the central meristem domain <xref rid="pgen.1003020-Goldshmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In fact, this mechanism also affects the floral meristem <xref rid="pgen.1003020-Goldshmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, and <italic>fil yab3</italic> mutants exhibit a high frequency of fruits with three valves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003020-g003">Figure 3E, 3F</xref>), possibly due to an increase in floral meristem size caused by the expansion of the <italic>WUS</italic> expression domain.</p><p>Similarly, the results presented in this work show that, despite <italic>FIL</italic> and <italic>YAB3</italic>, as well as <italic>JAG</italic>, are active in lateral regions of the ovary and not expressed in the presumptive replum (medial tissue), mutants affected in <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity have oversized repla with extra-large cells and interspersed stomata, indicating that these laterally expressed genes make an important contribution to the correct development of the medial region in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> fruit. Hence, it is most likely that <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity mediate replum development by negatively regulating, also via non-autonomous mechanisms, the expression of meristematic genes, specifically <italic>BP</italic>, in the replum.

Nevertheless, the low levels of <italic>JAG</italic>/<italic>FIL</italic> activity needed for promoting valve margin identity suggest a gradient in the activity of lateral factors.

On the other hand, lateral factors restrict medial factor expression to a small area that becomes the replum and, in a non-autonomous fashion, limit the expression levels of <italic>BP</italic> and <italic>RPL</italic> in medial tissues to ensure proper replum development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003020-g008">Figure 8</xref>).
