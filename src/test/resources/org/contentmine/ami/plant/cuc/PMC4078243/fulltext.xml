The cotyledon is the nutrient storage area in seeds, and it is critical for seed quality and yield.

In addition, <italic>cco</italic> seeds displayed reduced germination rate and gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) level, whereas the abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin (IAA) levels were increased. RNA-seq identified 1,093 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between WT and the <italic>cco</italic> mutant.

Flowering plants are divided into monocots and dicots based on the number of cotyledons. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as a paradigm for dicot embryonic development, cotyledons are specified from two lateral domains at the apical end of the embryo proper at the heart stage, showing bilateral symmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several studies have reported cotyledon mutants in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], <italic>Antirrhinum</italic>

These mutants have been used to identify a number of orthologous gene hierarchies that are involved in cotyledon development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The <italic>Arabidopsis cup-shaped cotyledon</italic> (<italic>CUC</italic>) genes (<italic>CUC1</italic>, <italic>CUC2</italic>, and <italic>CUC3</italic>), belonging to the plant-specific NAC transcription factor, <italic>Picea glauca NAC01</italic>, and <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</italic> (<italic>STM</italic>) are required for shoot apical meristem (SAM) formation and cotyledon separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <italic>STM</italic> induces the expression of <italic>CUC</italic> genes, and the induction is specific and independent of other meristem regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. <italic>STM</italic> negatively regulates <italic>ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1</italic> (<italic>AS1</italic>), and the mutation of <italic>AS1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> disrupts cotyledon development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. <italic>KNOTTED</italic>-like (<italic>KNAT6)</italic> is expressed at the boundary between the SAM and cotyledon later than <italic>STM</italic> and <italic>CUC</italic>, suggesting that <italic>KNAT6</italic> plays a crucial role in SAM maintenance and boundary establishment in embryos via the <italic>STM/CUC</italic> pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Phytohormones, primarily auxin, CK, BR, GA, ABA, and JA, orchestrate intrinsic developmental programs. Previous studies have greatly advanced the functions of individual hormone. During last two decades, extensive lists of genes involved in hormone synthesis, catabolism and signal transduction have been identified via the analysis of mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Auxin plays a key regulatory role in the initiation of cotyledon in the apical margin of the globular embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In many plant species, including <italic>Brassica napus</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and <italic>Norway spruce</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], studies have shown that cotyledon and SAM development could be inhibited by various polar auxin inhibitors in embryogenesis. PIN auxin efflux regulators are the best characterised components of auxin transport. The polar location of PIN1 is associated with the position of auxin accumulation in incipient cotyledons, and auxin flows into the primordium interior during cotyledon outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The <italic>pin1 pid</italic> double mutant completely lacks cotyledons and bilateral symmetry and exhibits increased <italic>CUC1</italic>, <italic>CUC2</italic> and <italic>STM</italic> expression, indicating that directional auxin transport is important for the establishment of bilateral symmetry and the promotion of cotyledon outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Similarly, the <italic>pid enp</italic> double mutant, which is similar to <italic>&#x0201c;laterne&#x0201d;</italic>, also abolishes cotyledon development, reflecting failed auxin accumulation in the apex, and <italic>ENP</italic> is necessary for cotyledon development via the control of <italic>PIN1</italic> polarity in the context of <italic>PID</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition to auxin, some studies have shown that CK affects cotyledon development. Exogenous application of benzyladenine (the synthetic cytokinin) onto hybrid larch somatic embryos reduced the cotyledon number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The <italic>amp</italic>-<italic>arabidopsis</italic> mutant demonstrated polycotyly, indicating an elevated cytokinin level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis ESR1</italic> and <italic>ESR2</italic>, whose expression levels are induced by cytokinin, not only control shoot regeneration but also play a role in cotyledon development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we characterised a soybean mutant named <italic>cco</italic>, which displayed curled cotyledons. The <italic>cco</italic> embryos at the torpedo stage resembled the &#x0201c;<italic>tail of swallow</italic>&#x0201d;. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that <italic>cco</italic> seeds contained higher IAA and ABA levels, but lower GA<sub>3</sub> level.

In higher plants, embryogenesis can be conceptually divided into three overlapping phases: morphogenesis, maturation and desiccation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In general, for the wild type at the globular stage, an embryo comprises a spherical embryo proper and a suspensor (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). The embryo proper is spherical during the pro-embryo and globular stage and eventually forms cotyledons, shoot meristem and hypocotyl region around the apical-basal axis, and this structure is connected to the embryo sac via the suspensor. During the globular-heart transition phase, a dramatic change occurs: two of the cotyledon primordia are symmetrically initiated from the lateral domains at the apical end of the heart-shaped embryo proper (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). Subsequently, the cotyledons and hypocotyl elongate, and the embryo enters the torpedo stage in which the cotyledons continue to rotate. The morphogenesis phase of embryogenesis ends at the cotyledon stage (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G).</p><p>However, the development of embryos in <italic>cco</italic> was slower than that in WT (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). When WT embryos were at the heart stage, <italic>cco</italic> embryos remained morphologically at the globular stage (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H). The embryo proper in <italic>cco</italic> appeared smaller than that in WT (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H). At the heart stage, cotyledons were initiated from the cotyledon primordia. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>I showed that the cotyledon initiation positions were identical in both the WT and <italic>cco</italic>. However, the WT cotyledons grew upwards, while that of the <italic>cco</italic> mutant demonstrated outward growth. Subsequently, the bifurcation of the cotyledons at the torpedo stage in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant was larger, and the tips of the cotyledons were sharper (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F to <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>J to <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>L). At the torpedo stage, <italic>cco</italic> mutant embryos resembled &#x0201c;<italic>tail of swallow</italic>&#x0201d;, while the radicle and shoot apical meristem were also present and appeared normal. All in all, <italic>cco</italic> showed abnormal embryogenesis, especially at the torpedo stage, when the <italic>cco</italic> cotyledons became more slender and grew outward. However, SAM and the polar axis were normal. Cotyledons and leaves share homology in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Cotyledon initiation and development in <italic>cco</italic> were defective, while leaf development was correct, suggesting partial homology between leaf and cotyledon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Increased free IAA and ABA levels, while decreased GA<sub>3</sub>level in <italic>cco</italic></title><p>The hormone auxin governs a variety of developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], including embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In embryogenesis, auxin controls cell division and specification, which are critical for establishing the embryo pattern. Most of the pattern formation events in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryogenesis, including cotyledon development, depend on auxin biosynthesis, transport, and response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. IAA is the most important natural auxin. Therefore, we examined the endogenous free IAA level in WT and the <italic>cco</italic> mutant seeds at 7 DAF (days after fertilisation) by HPLC analysis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Compared with WT, the <italic>cco</italic> mutant had a higher free IAA level in seeds at 7 DAF.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

The increased ABA/GA ratio may lead to a low germination rate for the <italic>cco</italic> mutant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Auxin sensitivity was depressed in <italic>cco</italic></title><p>Twelve auxin responsive genes, including two <italic>AUX/IAA</italic> genes (<italic>Glyma08g22190, Glyma10g32340</italic>), five <italic>GH3</italic> genes (<italic>Glyma02g13910, Glyma02g17360, Glyma11g05510, Glyma12g11890, Glyma12g11200</italic>) and five <italic>SAUR</italic> genes (<italic>Glyma10g06360, Glyma10g06370, Glyma05g36360, Glyma12g03780, Glyma09g35460</italic>), were selected to investigate the transcription of early auxin-regulated genes in response to auxin treatment by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, all of these genes were up-regulated in WT at 30&#x000a0;min after treatment with 0.05&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). However, in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant, only three genes (<italic>Glyma08g22190, Glyma12g11200, and Glyma09g35460</italic>) were weakly up-regulated, and the other genes had weak variation or even unexpected down-regulation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A).

Many of the DEGs were mapped to pathways essential for plant growth and development. Overall, 98 pathways were affected in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant, and some of these pathways were consistent with biological processes previously revealed in the GO analysis. The most frequently represented pathways primarily involved in secondary metabolism, including plant hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction (20.46%), such as auxin, CK, GA, ABA, ET, BR and JA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Asakura et al. found that genes expressed in the early pod stage of soybean were the most numerous, compared with 2 and 5&#x000a0;mm seeds, and the number of expressed genes gradually decreased with seed development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Commonly expressed genes in these stages accounted for 70&#x02013;95% of the expressed genes in each stage, and only a small number of genes were differentially expressed, which mainly included &#x003b2;-conglycinin, lipid synthesis, lipoxygenase and seed-maturation proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Therefore, most DEGs obtained in this study, including genes that were related to hormone biosynthesis and signalling, could still be identified in the early seed stage. However, some DEGs may have been missed because of tissue-dependent gene expression.</p><p>The results of the transcriptome data showed that many genes encoding proteins involved in auxin metabolism and signal transduction pathways were differentially expressed between <italic>cco</italic> and WT. L-tryptophan, as a primary precursor, is used to generate many indole-containing substances in plants, including IAA. &#x003b1;-subunit anthranilate synthase (ASA) catalyses the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate as one of the first steps in the <italic>Trp</italic> biosynthesis pathway. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, up-regulation of <italic>WEAK ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2/ANTHRANILATE SYNTHASE &#x003b1;1</italic> (<italic>WEI2/ASA1</italic>) gene through ET results in auxin accumulation in the tips of primary roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Transgenic rice lines expressing &#x003b1;-SUBUNIT OF ANTHRANILATE SYNTHASE (<italic>OASA1D)</italic> gene show increased production of tryptophan and free IAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Tryptophan synthase beta subunit (TSB) catalyses the last step in tryptophan biosynthesis. In IAA biosynthesis, indole-3-acetaldoximem (IAOx)-dependent IAA biosynthesis is a specific pathway in plants. In this process, two homologous cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP79B2 and CYP79B3, mediate the synthesis of IAOx from tryptophan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and the double mutation of these two genes results in the downregulation of IAA synthesis. In the transcriptome data obtained in this study, one <italic>ASA</italic> gene, one <italic>TBS</italic> gene and three <italic>CYP79</italic> genes were up-regulated, suggesting that auxin synthesis was enhanced in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Mounting evidence suggests that polar auxin transport (PAT) controls important growth and developmental processes in higher plants. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, studies have shown that the AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX/LAX) family of auxin transporters are major influx carriers, whereas the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family of auxin proteins are major efflux carriers. The AUX/LAX family is represented by four highly conserved genes, namely <italic>AUX1</italic>, <italic>LAX1</italic>, <italic>LAX2</italic>, and <italic>LAX3. LAX2</italic> regulates vascular patterning in cotyledons. Transcriptome data showed that three <italic>LAX2</italic> genes and one <italic>PIN</italic> gene were up-regulated in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant, indicating that auxin polar transport was also influenced. Auxin-responsive genes include <italic>GH3</italic> genes, <italic>small auxin up RNA (SAUR)</italic> genes and <italic>AUX/IAA</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In our transcriptome data, one <italic>AUX/IAA</italic> and five <italic>SAUR</italic> genes were down-regulated, and four <italic>SAUR</italic> genes were up-regulated in <italic>cco</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). All of the <italic>GH3</italic> genes were up-regulated, which were likely due to the down-regulation of the <italic>AUX/IAA</italic> genes as Aux/lAA proteins repress the expression of <italic>GH3</italic> genes in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Taken together, these data indicated that auxin biosynthesis and signal transduction in <italic>cco</italic> were more active than in WT.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>

In general, GA is required for seed development, which is determined through the analysis of GA-deficient mutants. In pea (<italic>Pisum sativum L.</italic>), the GA-biosynthesis mutant <italic>lh</italic> has provided the best evidence for the physiological role of GA in seed development. The LH protein, which encodes <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene oxidase (KO), is required for the three-step oxidation of <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene to <italic>ent</italic>-kaurenoic acid as an early step in the GA biosynthesis pathway altering seed development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. KS (<italic>ent</italic>-kaurene synthase) and KO are key enzymes in the GA biosynthetic pathway, and both are encoded by a single gene in soybean. GA<sub>2</sub>ox (GA<sub>2</sub>-oxidase) plays an important role in the last step of GA biosynthesis and catalyses the inactivation of GAs by conversion to bioactive GAs, thereby affecting the amount of bioactive GAs. Overexpression of <italic>GA</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>ox</italic> genes results in reduced GA level in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and poplar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. DELLA-domain proteins are transcriptional regulators that repress GA responses, and these proteins are rapidly degraded in response to GA. In this study, one <italic>KO</italic> gene and one <italic>KS</italic> gene were downregulated in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant, suggesting that an early step in GA biosynthesis was blocked (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). In addition, four <italic>GA</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>ox</italic> genes and three <italic>DELLA</italic> genes were up-regulated, suggesting that the rate of conversion of inactive GAs to bioactive GAs was limited for the <italic>cco</italic> mutant (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p>ABA not only plays an important role in the stress responses and plant tolerance, but also controls seed development and germination. The enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is involved in a rate-limiting step for ABA biosynthesis. Recently, Mart&#x000ed;nez-And&#x000fa;jar et al. reported that the <italic>NCED6</italic> induction enhanced seed dormancy in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Here, we showed that <italic>NCED</italic> genes were up-regulated in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant, suggesting that ABA synthesis was promoted. However, another gene encoding abscisic acid 8&#x02032;-hydroxylase, which catalyses a key step in ABA catabolism, was also up-regulated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Snf1-related protein kinases (SnRK2s) are key positive regulators in ABA signal transduction pathway. In the absence of ABA, protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2Cs) physically interact with SnRK2s and negatively regulate ABA responses. However, interactions between PP2Cs and SnRK2s are disrupted when an ABA molecule binds to PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE1 (PYR1)/PYR1-LIKE (PYL)/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (RCAR) receptors, leading to structural changes in these receptors. When SnRK2s are released from PP2C inhibition, their downstream targets, including ABA-Responsive Element Binding Factors (ABFs), are activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Fujii et al. constructed an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> line carrying mutations in all 10 members of the SnRK2 family. The decuple mutant <italic>snrk2.1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10</italic> (<italic>srk2g/d/e/a/h/e/f/c/j/b</italic>) was defective in gene regulation and ABA accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In our data, the <italic>PP2Cs</italic>, <italic>SnRK2</italic> and <italic>ABF</italic> genes were up-regulated in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In summary, ABA biosynthesis, catabolism and signalling were enhanced in <italic>cco</italic>.</p><p>In addition to auxin, GA and ABA, the pathways of other hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction (such as CK, ET, BR, and JA) were also influenced in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant. CK and ET, as major classes of plant hormone, are involved in various aspects of plant development, including organ development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In <italic>cco,</italic> we found two genes encoding adenosine-phosphate isopentenyltransferase (IPT), a rate-limiting enzyme in CK biosynthesis, expressed at significantly higher levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In CK signalling, type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS (ARRs) are transcriptional activators that regulate cytokinin targets, including type-A ARRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. We observed the up-regulation of two type-B ARR genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Aminocyclopropane-carboxylate oxidase (ACO), an &#x0201c;ethylene-forming enzyme&#x0201d; (EFE), catalyses the final step in ethylene biosynthesis, converting l-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) into ethylene, CO2, and cyanide. Four <italic>ACO</italic> genes were up-regulated in <italic>cco</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Antisense constructs of <italic>ACO</italic> genes can notably reduce ET production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. ET signalling was also influenced in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant, and the expression levels of ethylene-related genes encoding serine/threonine-protein kinase (CTR1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6), and ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF1/2) were altered in <italic>cco</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). BRs regulate embryonic and post-embryonic development, adult homeostasis and expression of numerous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Plant steroid hormones are recognised by brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 (BRI1), whose kinase activity is activated by exogenous BR application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. We also found that the expression levels of thirteen <italic>BR1</italic> and four <italic>BRI1 Associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1)</italic> genes in <italic>cco</italic> were higher than those in WT (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). JA regulates plant growth and stress responses, biosynthetic pathway of which starts with &#x003b1;-linolenic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The DEGs in JA biosynthesis and signalling pathway included those that encode phospholipase A1, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase, lipoxygenase, JASMONATE-ZIM (JAZ) and MYC2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] ( Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref> and Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p>Auxin, BR, CK and GA are generally considered major developmental growth regulators, whereas ABA, ET and JA are involved in stress responses, all of these hormones converge on auxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Auxin is not only a hormone but also a morphogen. Auxin accumulation is controlled by auxin biosynthesis and metabolism, the conjugation/deconjugation of active auxin to/from its inactive conjugated form and auxin transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Auxin maxima and activity have been implicated in embryo development and patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In <italic>cco</italic>, the free IAA level and auxin polar transport were affected. Polar auxin transport promotes the formation of local auxin maxima and gradients within tissues that play important roles in auxin action, such as the patterns of cell division and differentiation in the root meristem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and the establishment of cotyledons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Plants show directional growth in response to environmental stimuli such as light or gravity (tropisms). It was found that auxin played an important role in tropisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and unequal auxin distribution across organs may lead their bending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The cotyledons of <italic>cco</italic> showed outward bending, which allowed us to hypothesise that PAT might cause an auxin imbalance between the abaxial and adaxial side in cotyledons of the <italic>cco</italic> mutant, resulting in the adaxial side developing faster than the abaxial side. However, in soybean embryogenesis, the endosperm surrounds the embryo and cotyledons, the curled cotyledons observed in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant might reflect the fetter of the endosperm. Many signals can regulate auxin polar transport including stress, protein phosphorylation, reactive oxygen, flavonols and other hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], which among these signals affect(s) PAT in <italic>cco</italic> require further investigation. In <italic>cco</italic>, only the shape of cotyledons not including leaves was abnormal, indicating that signal(s) or mutated genes regulating PAT were specific for cotyledon initiation and growth.</p><p>GA and ABA have mainly been implicated in later stages of embryo development, acting antagonistically in the regulation of seed germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Compared with WT, <italic>cco</italic> showed higher IAA and ABA levels, whereas a lower GA<sub>3</sub> level. Several reports indicate that auxin and GA overlap in the regulation of multiple aspects of plant development, and there is positive cross-talk interaction between them. Willige et al. have reported that a mutant deficient in GA biosynthesis and signalling showed a reduced PIN protein level, which could be recovered by exogenous GA application. Moreover, GA could interact with PIN1 and promote cotyledon differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Auxin can also induce GA biosynthesis. Root cells with lower auxin level have reduced GA biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Interestingly, our results demonstrated a lower GA<sub>3</sub> but higher IAA level in <italic>cco</italic> seeds. But beyond that, <italic>cco</italic> seeds had higher ABA content, which might correlate with lower GA<sub>3</sub> level and may be the reason for lower germination rate in <italic>cco</italic>. Consistently, ABA negatively regulates bioactive GA level during seed germination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Multiple phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling pathways are reprogrammed in the <italic>cco</italic> mutant, which is consistent with our HPLC analysis. Our results indicate that curled-cotyledons and reduced seed germination rate may result from the biosynthesis and signalling disorder of multiple phytohormones. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that hormones not only act in a linear pathway but also function in a complex network of feedback regulation and cross talk within or between different hormone pathways. At present, the studies of molecular mechanisms underlying hormonal cross talk mainly focus on postembryonic development, including the roots, shoots and leaves. However, adequate models of the hormonal network involved in cotyledon development are not well established in plants.

The IAA and ABA concentration was determined at 254&#x000a0;nm, and the GA<sub>3</sub> concentration was determined at 210&#x000a0;nm. Hormone measurements were conducted in triplicate and subjected to statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>IAA sensibility assay</title><p>WT and <italic>cco</italic> seeds were germinated in moistened vermiculite at 30&#x000b0;C. After 72&#x000a0;h, the seedlings were sprayed with 2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>&#x000a0;M 2,4-D solution (pH&#x000a0;6). The intact hypocotyls were then segregated from the seedlings and incubated in 10&#x000a0;ml of incubation medium in the absence or presence of 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>&#x000a0;M and 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>&#x000a0;M 2,4-D (pH&#x000a0;6) at 30&#x000b0;C with continuous shaking. At 0.5 and 1&#x000a0;h, the 1.2-cm sections obtained from the elongating region of the hypocotyls (0.5-1.7&#x000a0;cm below the cotyledons) were excised. The hypocotyl sections were rinsed in deionised distilled H<sub>2</sub>0 and immediately frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. The sections were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until further use for RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>cDNA library construction for RNA-Seq and sequencing</title><p>Beads with oligo (dT) were used to isolate poly (A) mRNA after total RNA was collected. Fragmentation buffer was added to digest the mRNA to generate short fragments. These short fragments were used as templates, and random hexamer-primers were used to synthesise first-strand cDNA. Second-strand cDNA was synthesised in a reaction containing buffer, dNTPs, RNase H and DNA polymerase I. Short fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR extraction kit (QIAGEN) and eluted in EB buffer for end preparation and poly (A) addition. Subsequently, the short fragments were ligated with sequencing adaptors. For PCR amplification, we selected suitable fragments to use as templates based on the results of agarose gel electrophoresis. The libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq&#x02122; 2000 system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Raw read filtering and mapping to the reference genome and genes sequences</title><p>Dirty raw reads were discarded via the following four steps: 1. reads with adaptors were removed; 2. reads with unknown nucleotides larger than 5% were removed; 3. reads with low quality (more than half of the base quality less than 5) were removed; 4. clean reads were obtained. Clean reads were mapped to the reference genome and genes sequences respectively using SOAPaligner/soap2. Mismatches with no more than m (m default is 5) bases were used in the alignment. All subsequent analyses were based on clean reads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Gene expression annotation</title><p>Gene coverage is the percentage of a gene covered by reads. This value equals the ratio of the number of bases in a gene covered by unique mapping reads to the number of total bases in that gene. The UniGene expression was calculated using the RPKM method (Reads Per kb per Million reads). The RPKM method eliminated the influence of different gene lengths and sequencing discrepancies on the gene expression calculations. Therefore, the calculated gene expression could be used to directly compare differences in gene expression between the samples. If there was more than one transcript for a gene, the longest transcript was used to calculate the expression level and coverage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Differentially expressed gene analysis</title><p>Using &#x0201c;The significance of digital gene expression profiles&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], we identified differentially expressed genes between WT and the <italic>cco</italic> mutant based on the following criteria: (FDR)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 and |log<sub>2</sub>Ratio|&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis</title><p>The differentially expressed genes were subjected to GO enrichment analysis.
