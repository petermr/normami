Morphogenesis accompanied by continuous growth requires stable positional information in order to make well-proportioned shapes. From the structure of lungs to the branching of trees, nearly evenly spaced branches represent a major type of morphogenic process and various mathematical models have been applied to explain each phenomenon <xref rid="pone.0111615-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111615-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Branching morphogenesis in plants is often accompanied by growth. One example is compound leaf development. Although plant leaves exhibit striking diversity in their shapes, they can be roughly classified into two classes: simple and compound. Simple leaves have a single blade, whereas compound leaves have multiple blade units. In both types of leaves, a leaf begins as a small bulge, called a leaf primordium, at the tip of the shoot apex. The leaf primordium grows rapidly by cell division and cell expansion, eventually forming the mature leaf shape. In the case of compound leaves, new leaflet primordia emerge iteratively on a growing leaf primordium <xref rid="pone.0111615-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111615-Ikeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Recently, a laser ablation experiment on <italic>Eschscholzia californica</italic> leaf primordia revealed that a constant-spacing regulatory mechanism governs leaflet initiation sites <xref rid="pone.0111615-Ikeuchi2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Some geometric features of leaf shapes have been theoretically investigated <xref rid="pone.0111615-Prsinkiewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The theoretical understanding of leaf shape determination has recently dramatically improved <xref rid="pone.0111615-Prusinkiewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111615-Prusinkiweicz1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111615-Bilsbrough1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. For example, Bilsbrough et al. (2011) explained the mechanism underlying the formation of a simple leaf with serrations on its margin by using a mathematical model that utilized a repeated iterative pattern. It has been suggested that the framework of this serration model could also explain the morphogenesis of more complex leaf shapes <xref rid="pone.0111615-Prusinkiweicz1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The spatially periodic pattern was simulated using the polar auxin transport (PAT) model, which has been widely used to explain various aspects of plant morphogenesis, including phyllotaxis, leaf vascular patterning, and root development <xref rid="pone.0111615-VanBerkel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111615-Reinhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111615-Scarpella1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111615-Sabatini1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In the leaf morphogenesis, PAT was caused by interactions of the growth-promoting phytohormone auxin, PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1: auxin efflux carrier protein) <xref rid="pone.0111615-Hay1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2: transcription factor that negatively regulates local growth rate) <xref rid="pone.0111615-Nikovics1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>We studied the North American lake cress (<italic>Rorippa aquatica</italic>), which is a semi-aquatic member of the family Brassicaceae, as a model to explain leaf diversity. <italic>R</italic>. <italic>aquatica</italic> changes the shape of its leaves depending on the growth conditions (e.g., underwater submergence and temperature) <xref rid="pone.0111615-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Such morphological plasticity is called heterophylly. The leaf shape can range from simple elliptical to a complex, highly branched compound morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Intermediate forms have also been observed. This plant is a theoretically good model to study leaf morphogenesis since such variation in the leaf shape is observed even within a single plant. There may be a common morphological mechanism that produces the various leaf-shapes in heterophylly. If so, it can be explained by a simple model.</p><fig id="pone-0111615-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111615.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Morphogenesis of <italic>Rorippa aquatica</italic> leaves.</title><p>A, B: Mature leaf morphology of the simple leaf that was developed at 30&#x000b0;C (A) and the highly branched compound leaf that was developed at 20&#x000b0;C (B).

<italic>R</italic>. <italic>aquatica</italic> develops smooth-margin simple leaves when grown at 30&#x000b0;C, and compound leaves of a multi-order branched structure when grown at 20&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). The simple leaf has iterative hydathodes on its margin, which are generally seen at the tip of serrations in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. The leaves at the earliest stages of development at the shoot apex were dissected and used to examine the branching pattern formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). A shoot apex contains leaf primordia at different stages of morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g001">Fig. 1D&#x02013;F</xref>). By the observation of dissected shoot apex and from time-lapse movies [Nakayama et al. in preparation] the branched structure of the compound leaf formed through repetitive additions of protrusions that are future leaflets (i.e., leaflet primordia). The number of leaflets increased gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g001">Fig. 1D&#x02013;F</xref>). First, primary leaflets appeared on both sides of a leaf primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), and secondary leaflets emerged on the primary leaflets after some elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g001">Fig. 1E, F</xref>). The increase in the total number of leaflets of all categories (i.e., terminal, primary, secondary, tertiary) was plotted as a progression of the primary leaflet formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). The dynamics of repetitive leaflet initiations prompted us to consider that a spatially periodic pattern occurs during compound leaf development in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>aquatica</italic>.</p><p>The total number of leaflets reached a plateau when the leaf became approximately 4 mm in height. At this point, the number of primary leaflets also reached a plateau. Because the number of leaflets on the primary leaflet of mature leaves is almost the same as the number of leaflet primordia on primary leaflets of immature leaves as described later, it is suggested that the branched structures of both mature and immature leaves are geometrically similar. This means that branching is fixed after that specific stage, and the duration of leaflet formation seems constant and determined. From time-lapse recordings of developing leaves, it was observed that new protrusions emerge in the recently elongated regions of a leaf, which exist on the both sides of the tip and the base of the first primary leaflets [Nakayama et al. in preparation].</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Modeling for branched structure of compound leaves</title><p>In order to explain the branching dynamics in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>aquatica</italic> leaves, we utilized the framework of a previously developed mathematical model <xref rid="pone.0111615-Bilsbrough1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The leaf margin was regarded as a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion domain, which was composed of segmented lines simulating cells. The leaf margin was deformed based on the spatially periodic pattern using the boundary propagation method (BPM), which abstractly achieves this geometric deformation <xref rid="pone.0111615-Sethian1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Briefly, the growth direction of the connection point was vector sum of the normal unit vector of adjacent cells and the growth rate was proportional to the average concentration of reactant in adjacent cells. Segments over a certain length were divided into two daughter cells, which had the reactants state of mother cell.</p><fig id="pone-0111615-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111615.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal plot and growth profiles for the BPM rings by pattern dependent expansion.</title><p>A: Schematic of the modeling.

To support the experimental observations, in which new branches were inserted into newly generated gaps between two leaflets, we calculated the RD pattern formation using the parameters that showed insertions of reactant peaks. Expansion at the position of reactant peak makes the peak unstable then it generally induces the peak splitting. However, in appropriate parameter region, regular peak doubling by insertion can be generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111615.s001">Movie S1</xref>). For easy selection of pattern behavior on growing domain, the linear activator-inhibitor model was used.</p><p>As an initial condition, six cells that had random values of reactants <italic>u</italic> and <italic>v</italic> were connected as a ring. The ring grew in one direction based on the location of the first-emerged reactant peak (represented blue in; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g002">Fig. 2C&#x02013;F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111615.s001">Movie S1</xref>) and subsequently, the first insertion was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111615.s001">Movie S1</xref>). The second peak emerged on the opposite side of the first peak. When we regarded either of them as a terminal leaflet, the ring was stretched toward each peak to make the main axis (i.e., the proximodistal axis) of leaf growth. Next, tertiary peaks were formed in the center of intervals, which become wider between the first and second peaks, resulting in two secondary axes that corresponded to the primary leaflets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111615.s001">Movie S1</xref>). As the reactant peaks were inserted in order, new secondary axes joined four by four on the recently extended region of the main axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111615.s001">Movie S1</xref>). In addition, ternary axes, corresponding to the secondary leaflets, were generated on the extended region of the secondary axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111615.s001">Movie S1</xref>).</p><p>The simulated branching dynamics recapitulate the qualitative aspects of the morphogenesis of compound leaves in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>aquatica</italic>. Hence, the developmental model for indented simple leaves <xref rid="pone.0111615-Bilsbrough1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> is also applicable to the morphogenesis of branched compound leaves. The behaviors of spatially periodic patterns on uniform growing domain have been well studied and analyzed. On the other hand, the study about the behaviors of the patterns on reactant-dependent growing domain is still limited especially in the case of peak insertion. Here, we show that a linear RD pattern can be reduplicated by regular insertion using appropriate parameters. Whatever the mechanism governing the periodic pattern, this nested branched pattern was generated by the simple rule of a continuous growth dependent on spatially periodic pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Comparison between the simulation and actual-leaf branching dynamics</title><p>Even with the distinctive character, the snapshot of shapes of organisms can be simulated by various models.

Furthermore, the natural leaflet distributions varied mildly compared to the peaked theoretical values.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Branch formation by expansion inhibition</title><p>Recently, Vlad <italic>et al.</italic> reported that cell proliferation in the sinus region was inhibited in a gene expression pattern dependent manner at the formation of a compound leaf in <italic>Cardamine hirsuta</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0111615-Vlad1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore we attempted a method that was opposite case to that described in the previous sections. The leaf margin was expanded constantly then the expansion was inhibited based on the spatially periodic pattern. As a result, fundamentally equal branched pattern and branching process were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g005">Fig. 5B&#x02013;E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111615.s003">Movie S3</xref>), even in the case of expansion inhibition. Because the region without the reactant peaks bulged outward, the branching was generated by repetitive splittings of the pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111615-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111615.s003">Movie S3</xref>). This is simply the reverse case of the insertion of Turing-pattern behavior on growing domain <xref rid="pone.0111615-Meinhardt2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Insertion of peak emerges at the region where the activator is deficient. Thus, it is important to keep the distance between two successive peaks of activators relatively large while domain growth to make insertion happens. To make splitting happen, opposite situation is needed.</p><fig id="pone-0111615-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111615.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal plot and growth profiles for the BPM rings by Expansion inhibition.</title><p>A: Spatiotemporal plot for peak doubling by splitting.

The asynchronous branching can be caused, even in the equal interval pattern, by the introduction of anisotropic growth. In such cases, it is difficult to accurately estimate the increase in the number of leaflets by the methods described in this work. In addition, we assumed interactions among branches in this model; without the interactions, the same results would be calculated using certain timings of branching. Therefore, in order to confirm the biological significance of this model, the existence of interactions among branches should be tested.
