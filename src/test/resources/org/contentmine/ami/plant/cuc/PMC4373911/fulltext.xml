Early season flooding reduces germination, survival and growth rate of maize seedlings. We aimed to discover genetic variation for submergence tolerance in maize and elucidate the genetic basis of submergence tolerance through transcriptional profiling and linkage analysis of contrasting genotypes. A diverse set of maize nested association mapping (NAM) founder lines were screened, and two highly tolerant (Mo18W and M162W) and sensitive (B97 and B73) genotypes were identified. Tolerant lines exhibited delayed senescence and lower oxidative stress levels compared to sensitive lines. Transcriptome analysis was performed on these inbreds to provide genome level insights into the molecular responses to submergence. Tolerant lines had higher transcript abundance of several fermentation-related genes and an unannotated <italic>Pyrophosphate-Dependent Fructose-6-Phosphate 1-Phosphotransferase</italic> gene during submergence. A coexpression network enriched for <italic>CBF</italic> (<italic>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR</italic>: <italic>C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR</italic>) genes, was induced by submergence in all four inbreds, but was more activated in the tolerant Mo18W. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from Mo18W and B73 was screened for submergence tolerance. A major QTL named <italic>Subtol6</italic> was mapped to chromosome 6 that explains 22% of the phenotypic variation within the RIL population. We identified two candidate genes (<italic>HEMOGLOBIN2</italic> and <italic>RAV1</italic>) underlying <italic>Subtol6</italic> based on contrasting expression patterns observed in B73 and Mo18W.

These changes in precipitation patterns will impact many maize-producing regions of the world, which receive considerable rainfall during early growing season [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Maize is highly sensitive to waterlogging and submergence (complete inundation) during germination and seedling stages and leads to poor seedling establishment, stunted growth, and delayed development. Most of the previous research has focused on waterlogging, while submergence tolerance remains less characterized in maize [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>At a cellular level, hypoxic conditions during submergence reduce protein translation and induce selectively translated proteins involved in glycolysis and the fermentative pathways [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The shift to anaerobic respiration allows the plants to continue producing ATP, albeit at a considerably lower rate, while carbon reserves are still available [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As part of a metabolic adaptation to hypoxia, several ATP consuming biochemical pathways are inhibited [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, survival through prolonged inundation hypoxia also involves the use of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) as an alternative energy source and induction of enzymes that reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) or cytoplasmic acidosis [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in the submergence responses in plants have largely been characterized in two tolerant species, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and <italic>Rumex palustris</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. One of the early responses to submergence involves the differential regulation of a suite of transcription factors belonging to the ethylene response factor (ERFs) gene family [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

The extent of genetic variation for submergence tolerance in maize is largely unexplored. Utilizing the natural variation in maize for submergence tolerance studies has become more tractable due to availability of genetic resources such the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) populations and high-density marker information [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The aims of this study were to (i) assess the natural variation for submergence tolerance in maize germplasm by screening the diverse maize founder lines, (ii) examine the molecular responses to submergence through transcriptional profiling of a subset of tolerant and sensitive inbreds, and (iii) elucidate the genetic basis of submergence tolerance through QTL analysis. We show that substantial variation for submergence tolerance exists in maize NAM population germplasm, and identify a major QTL associated with submergence tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Maize inbreds exhibit significant phenotypic diversity for submergence tolerance</title><p>A panel of 23 genetically diverse maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) parental lines, representing five subpopulations, and B73 were screened for submergence tolerance for a period of 48 h or 96 h.

Interestingly, the RILs harboring the B73 allele at <italic>Subtol6</italic>, were considerably more sensitive to submergence than those with the Mo18W allele. Since B73 is widely used in many U.S. breeding programs, this suggests that there is a need for improving submergence tolerance in lines that have retained alleles associated with B73 submergence sensitivity.</p><p>The submergence tolerant lines identified from our experiments displayed delayed senescence in response to complete submergence. Lower ROS levels were observed in the tolerant lines during submergence. An increase in ROS has been reported in plants exposed to submergence and hypoxic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120385.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. One of the likely candidate genes that we propose for <italic>Subtol6</italic> is <italic>HB2</italic>. This is based on the expression differences between the parent inbreds (Mo18W and B73) and previously reported role of <italic>HB2</italic> in plant survival in low oxygen or low ATP conditions [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Our observations that the tolerant Mo18W has higher <italic>HB2</italic> transcript abundance, lower ROS levels and minimal senescence after submergence stress present <italic>HB2</italic> as an attractive candidate for <italic>Subtol6</italic>.</p><p>The second candidate gene underlying the <italic>Subtol6</italic> that we propose is the maize ortholog of <italic>AtRAV1</italic>, a member of the ERF gene family. Maize <italic>RAV1</italic> transcript abundance was lower in Mo18W relative to B73 under control and submerged conditions. Although, <italic>RAV1</italic> expression is induced in both Mo18W and B73, the up-regulation in B73 is higher than Mo18W in response to submergence. The differential expression pattern of <italic>RAV1</italic> between Mo18W and B73 is noteworthy because overexpression of <italic>RAV1</italic> in Arabidopsis is known to lead to early senescence. In wildtype Arabidopsis plants, <italic>RAV1</italic> expression is induced during onset of senescence [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This is consistent with the increased senescence observed in B73 relative to Mo18W after submergence stress. Although our selection of candidates for <italic>Subtol6</italic> is based on gene expression level differences, it is possible that the genetic basis of the <italic>Subtol6</italic> gene(s) could be due to sequence polymorphism in the underlying gene that has comparable transcript abundance during submergence and in control conditions. It is also possible that Mo18W may have additional gene(s) not present in the reference genome based on B73 as was the case with the rice <italic>Sub1</italic> locus. Future characterization of the <italic>Subtol6</italic> locus will address these possibilities and elucidate the casual gene underlying <italic>Subtol6</italic>.</p><p>Several <italic>CBF/DREB</italic> genes were induced in response to submergence in maize. This response was only observed in maize and is missing in rice and Arabidopsis. <italic>CBF</italic> genes act together in a transcriptional network and are expressed in response to a variety of conditions such as low temperature, dehydration, mechanical agitation, and senescence [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Notably, the induction of the CBF transcriptional network was stronger in the tolerant Mo18W, indicating that a <italic>CBF</italic>-mediated response may be more active in this line. In our study, submergence-induced senescence was delayed considerably in Mo18W compared to B73 and B97.

Both tolerant inbreds had higher transcript abundance of ethanol fermentation related genes, specifically <italic>PDC3</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic> compared to sensitive inbreds. In hypoxic conditions, PDC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde, which is then converted to ethanol by ADH providing NAD<sup>+</sup> for glycolysis [<xref rid="pone.0120385.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
