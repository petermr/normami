In many eudicot plants, the primordia of sepals and petals (the floral organs) first arise sequentially at the edge of a circular, undifferentiated region called the floral meristem, and later transition into a concentric arrangement called a whorl, which includes four or five organs. The properties controlling the transition to whorls comprising particular numbers of organs is little explored. We propose a development-based model of floral organ-number determination, improving upon earlier models of plant phyllotaxis that assumed two developmental processes: the sequential initiation of primordia in the least crowded space around the meristem and the constant growth of the tip of the stem. By introducing mutual repulsion among primordia into the growth process, we numerically and analytically show that the whorled arrangement emerges spontaneously from the sequential initiation of primordia. Moreover, by allowing the strength of the inhibition exerted by each primordium to decrease as the primordium ages, we show that pentamerous whorls, in which the angular and radial positions of the primordia are consistent with those observed in sepal and petal primordia in <italic>Silene coeli-rosa</italic>, Caryophyllaceae, become the dominant arrangement. The organ number within the outmost whorl, corresponding to the sepals, takes a value of four or five in a much wider parameter space than that in which it takes a value of six or seven. These results suggest that mutual repulsion among primordia during growth and a temporal decrease in the strength of the inhibition during initiation are required for the development of the tetramerous and pentamerous whorls common in eudicots.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Why do most eudicot flowers have either four or five petals? This fundamental and attractive problem in botany has been little investigated. Here, we identify the properties responsible for organ-number determination in floral development using mathematical modeling. Earlier experimental and theoretical studies showed that the arrangements of preexisting organs determine where a new organ will arise. Expanding upon those studies, we integrated two interactions between floral organs: (1) spatially and temporally decreased inhibition of new organ initiation by preexisting organs, and (2) mutual repulsion among organs such that they are &#x0201c;pushed around&#x0201d; during floral development. In computer simulations incorporating such initiation inhibition and mutual repulsion, the floral organs spontaneously formed several circles, consistent with the concentric circular arrangement of sepals and petals in eudicot flowers. Each circle tended to contain four or five organs arranged in positions that agreed quantitatively with the organ positions in the pentamerous flower, <italic>Silene coeli-rosa</italic>, Caryophyllaceae. These results suggest that the temporal decay of initiation inhibition and the mutual repulsion among growing organs determine the particular organ number during eudicot floral development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MSK is a JSPS Research Fellow (24.1243).

Digit numbers in vertebrates are evolutionarily optimized for the specific demands of the organism [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; the body-segment number in insects is constant despite the evolutionarily diversified gene regulation in each segment [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; and five petals are indispensable to forming the butterfly-like shape that is unique to legume flowers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Studies of animal structures, such as vertebrate limbs and insect segments, strongly suggest that crosstalk between pre-patterns (e.g., morphogen gradients) and self-organizing patterns underlies the developmental process of organ-number determination [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In plant development, a self-organization based on the polar transport of the phytohormone auxin [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] is conserved among seed plants [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and seems to be the main regulator of the development of a hierarchal body plan, called a shoot, consisting of a stem and lateral organs such as leaves. The number of concentration peaks in most self-organizing patterns, such as Turing pattern and the mechanisms proposed for plant-pattern formation, is proportional to the field size [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite having a diversified field size for floral-organ patterning, the eudicots, the most diverged clade among plants, commonly have pentamerous or tetramerous flowers containing five or four sepals and petals (the outer floral organs), respectively, and rarely have other numbers of organs [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we focus on the developmental properties that so precisely and universally determine the floral organ numbers through self-organizing processes.</p><p>Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves around the stem, provides insight into floral development, because studies of floral organ-identity determination [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have verified Goethe&#x02019;s foliar theory, which insists that a flower is a short shoot with specialized leaves [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Phyllotaxis is mainly classified into two types: spiral phyllotaxis, which has a constant divergence angle and internode length, and whorled phyllotaxis, which has several leaves at the same level of a stem [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For spiral phyllotaxis, Hofmeister described a hypothesis of pattern formation in 1868 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which we summarize in three basic rules: the time periodicity of primordia initiation, the initiation of a primordium at the largest available space at the edge of the meristem (the undifferentiated stem-cell region), and the relative movement of primordia in a centrifugal direction from the apex due to the growth of the stem tip. Following that hypothesis, numerous mathematical models incorporating contact pressure [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], inhibitor diffusion [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], reaction-diffusion [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and mechanical buckling of the epidermis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] were proposed to explain the observed phyllotactic patterns. Over the past ten years, these mathematical models were tested and interpreted in light of modern molecular biology. Several studies have suggested that the competitive polar transport of the auxin accounts for two of Hofmeister&#x02019;s rules, the periodicity of initiation and the initiation at the largest space, which together are capable of reproducing both spiral phyllotaxis and whorled phyllotaxis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Despite their simple rules and uncertain molecular basis, the phyllotaxis models can account for several of the quantitative properties observed in organ patterning. For example, one model showed that the divergence angle between successive leaves is 180 degrees for the first and second leaves, 90 degrees for the second and third leaves, and oscillating thereafter, converging to the golden angle, 137.5 degrees, which agrees with the phyllotaxis of true leaves in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> after the two cotyledons [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similar oscillatory convergence to a particular divergence angle occurs in the sepal primordia of the pentamerous flower of <italic>Silene coeli-rosa</italic>, Caryophyllaceae. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>coeli-rosa</italic>, the divergence angle is 156 degrees at first, and then it oscillates, converging on 144 degrees [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The golden angle also appears in the floral organs of several Ranunculaceae species [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The agreements between the phyllotaxis models and actual floral development suggest that mathematical models can give useful clues to the underlying mechanisms of not only phyllotaxis but also floral organ patterning.</p><p>There are at least three fundamental differences, however, between real floral development and the phyllotaxis models. The first difference is the assumption of constant primordium displacement during tip growth, which comes from Hofmeister&#x02019;s hypothesis and has been incorporated into most phyllotaxis models. Although the helical initiation has been thought to always result in spiral phyllotaxis, many eudicots form the whorled-type sepal arrangements in their blooming flowers subsequent to helical initiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g001">Fig 1</xref>; e.g., Caryophyllaceae [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], Solanaceae [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Nitrariaceae [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and Rosaceae [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). The remnants of helical initiation are more obvious in the pseudo-whorls (e.g., Ranunculaceae [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]), where the distance between each organ primordium and the floral center varies slightly even in the whorls of mature flowers, which usually have more varied floral organ numbers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], suggesting that post-meristematic modifications of primordia positions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] play an essential role in generating the whorled arrangement and determining the floral organ number during floral development. In contrast, most phyllotaxis models have assumed constant growth of the primordia, so that the whorls appear only after the simultaneous initiation of several primordia [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The second difference comes from the fact that floral development is a transient process, whereas most phyllotaxis models have focused on the steady state of the divergence angle. Although the golden angle (137.5 degrees) is quite close to the inner angle of regular pentagon (144 degrees), the developmental convergence from 180 degrees (cotyledon) to 137&#x02013;144 degrees in phyllotaxis requires the initiation of more than five primordia, both in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> leaves and in the mathematical models [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, the divergence angle between the second and third sepal primordia in pentamerous eudicot flower development is already close to 144 degrees [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The third difference comes from the accuracy of the floral organ number in many eudicots. Although the polar auxin-transport model reproduced both wild-type and mutant <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> floral organ positioning [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the organ number in the model was more variable, even with an identical parameter set (Fig 3 in [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]), than that in experimental observations (Table 1 in [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Moreover, among eudicot species, the appearance of pentamerous flowers is robust, despite the diversity of the meristem size and the outer structures, including the number and position of outside organs such as bracts [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Together, the differences between real floral development and previous phyllotaxis models indicate that floral development requires additional mechanisms to determine the particular organ number.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004145.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004145.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram for pentamerous flower development.</title><p>Sepal initiation (the first row), arrangement of sepal (black) and petal (white) whorls in blooming flower (the second row).

The radial position of the organs (the third row), namely the distance between the organ and floral apex, is spaced regularly in a spiral arrangement, whereas it has a gap between the fifth and sixth organs in the pentamerous pseudo-whorled and whorled arrangement. Regarding the hypothetical time evolution of the radial position (the fourth row), in all arrangements, the radial position increases with the progression of floral development. In the spiral arrangement, the radial position of the organ is always spaced regularly. In the pseudo-whorled and whorled arrangement subsequent to helical initiation, the radial position of organs within a whorl becomes closer during growth. In the whorled arrangement following simultaneous initiation, the radial position of the organs within a whorl is always identical.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1004145.g001"/></fig><p>To resolve the inconsistencies between the earlier models and actual floral development, we set out a simple modeling framework, integrating Hofmeister&#x02019;s rules with two additional assumptions, namely, the repulsion between primordia that can repress primordium growth and the temporal decrease in initiation inhibition of new primordium, which were proposed independently in the contact pressure model [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and the inhibitory field model [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], respectively, for phyllotaxis. First, when we incorporated mutual repulsion among primordia into the growth process, a whorled-type pattern emerged spontaneously following the sequential initiation of primordia. The mutual repulsion obstructed the radial movement of a new primordium after a specific number of primordia arose, causing a new whorl to emerge. The number of primordia in the first whorl tended to be four or eight. Second, when we assumed that older primordia have less influence on the initiation of a new primordium, the pentamerous whorl arrangement, which is the most common arrangement in eudicot flowers, became dominant. We analytically show the conditions for the development of tetramerous and pentamerous whorls, and we predict possible molecular and physiological underpinnings.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Model</title><p>Following Hofmeister&#x02019;s rules as mathematically interpreted by Douady and Couder [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], we focused on initiation and growth, the two processes of floral development. In the initiation process, each primordium emerges successively at the least crowded position, depending on a potential function [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We assumed periodic initiation to examine how the sequential initiation results in the whorled-type pattern. We allowed the primordia to move during the growth process in response to the repulsion among the primordia, unlike earlier studies that assumed constant growth depending only on the distance from the apex [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><sec id="sec003"><title>The initiation process</title><p>Following the earlier models [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], we represented the meristem as a circular disc with radius <italic>R</italic>

As one of the simplest setups for sequential initiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we followed the assumption of earlier models for spiral phyllotaxis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which state that new primordia arise sequentially with time intervals <italic>&#x003c4;</italic>, as opposed to the simultaneous initiation studied previously for whorled phyllotaxis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Although the structures outside of the flower, such as bracts and other flowers, as well as the position of the inflorescence axis, may affect the position of organ primordia, the pentamerous whorls appear despite their various arrangement [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, as the first step of modelling of floral organ arrangement, we assumed that whorl formation is independent of any positional information from structures outside of the flower. Thus, we calculated the inhibition potential only from floral organ primordia which are derived from a single floral meristem.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004145.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004145.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Emergence of multiple whorls in model simulations.</title><p>

Up-the-gradient positive feedback amplifies local auxin concentration maxima and depletes auxin from the surrounding epidermis, causing spatially periodic concentration peaks to self-organize [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and thus determine the initiation position of the primordia [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The amplification and depletion work as short-range activation and long-range inhibition, respectively [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which are common to Turing patterns of reaction-diffusion systems [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since the interaction of local maxima in the reaction-diffusion systems follows the exponential potential [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the up-the-gradient model likely explains the exponential potential between the auxin maxima, while the rigorous derivation requires further research. The decay length <italic>&#x003bb;</italic>
<sub><italic>ini</italic></sub> depends not only on the ratio of the auxin diffusion constant and the polar auxin-transport rate [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] but also on other biochemical parameters for polar transport and the underlying intracellular PIN1 cycling [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Another mechanism, referred to as the with-the-flux model [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], has been proposed for the polar auxin transport. Although with-the-flux positive feedback can also produce spatial periodicity, the primordia position corresponds to auxin minima [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which is inconsistent with observations [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the with-the-flux mechanism can explain auxin drain from the epidermal layer of the primordia to internal tissue [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Since the drain gets stronger as the primordia mature [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], the auxin drain could cause decay of the potential depending on the primordia age. The auxin decrease in maturing organs can also be caused by controlling auxin biosynthesis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

Therefore, the fifth primordium moves outward at constant velocity so that the tetramerous whorl is unlikely to emerge. The inward-directed potential at the position of the new primordium first appears when the sixth primordium arises around 343 degrees, which was derived by the recursive calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The first primordium (the rightmost potential peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) prevents the outward movement of the sixth primordium (red circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Arrest of radial displacement of the sixth primordium is maintained until the seventh primordium arises to allow the radial gap between these primordia to appear (i.e., a pentamerous whorl emerged). After the appearance, the growth potential gradients of the sixth and the seventh primordia become outward-directed, providing their constant growth with keeping the radial gap to the first whorl.

Because our model assumes sequential initiation of the primordia, it does not cover the floral development of all eudicots; sepal primordia arise simultaneously in some eudicot clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g001">Fig 1</xref>; e.g., mimosoid legume [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]). Likewise, in later development, several primordia arise at once in the stamen and carpel whorls (e.g., Ranunculaceae [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). The transitions between simultaneous and sequential development have two additional intriguing implications for evolutionary developmental biology. First, the initiation types may affect the stochastic variation of floral organ numbers, possibly caused by the absence or presence of pseudo-whorls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and the noisy expression domain of homeotic genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Second, such transitions occur even in animal body segmentation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], possibly caused by evolution of both gene regulatory network topologies and embryonic growth [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The limitations of the model can be reduced by introducing initiation whenever and wherever the potential (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004145.e002">Eq 2</xref>) is below a threshold, allowing simultaneous as well as sequential initiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The threshold model exhibiting both types of initiation does not by itself result in the dominance of particular merosities [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Incorporating two mechanisms, mutual growth repulsion and temporally decreasing inhibition at the point of initiation, into the threshold model could explain the dominance of particular merosities following both the sequential and the simultaneous initiation of floral organ primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Another problem is the absence of trimerous whorls in the present model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004145.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The transition between the trimery and tetramery or pentamery, and vice versa, occurred multiple times during the evolution of angiosperms. Therefore, trimerous flowers are scattered across the basal angiosperms, monocots, and a few families of eudicots [<xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004145.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Elucidating the developmental mechanisms underlying the transitions between the different merosities, as well as those between sequential and simultaneous initiation, will be an important avenue for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>One problem in determining floral organ number is how to generate whorls comprised of a specific number of organs.
