Primordia are initiated from the peripheral zone of the SAM in a predictable pattern, and develop into leaves during the vegetative stage, and into flowers during the reproductive phase. Each flower consists of four concentric whorls of organ types: the protective sepals, the showy petals, the male stamens, and the female carpels [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Between the meristem and newly formed leaf or flower primordia, a boundary forms with specialized cells that separate meristematic activity from determinate organ growth [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cells in the boundary have reduced rates of cell division, concave surfaces, elongated shapes, and exhibit low auxin concentration compared to the adjacent cells in meristems or primordia [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There are two types of boundaries in the developing shoot apices. M-O (meristem-organ) boundaries separate leaf and flower primordia from the SAM, whereas O-O (organ-organ) boundaries develop between individual floral organs and create space between them [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Based on boundary-specific expression patterns and mutant defects in boundary formation, organ separation, SAM initiation and maintenance, branching, or floral organ patterning, several transcription factors have been identified as important boundary regulators, including <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDONS 1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>3 (CUC1</italic>, <italic>CUC2</italic>, <italic>CUC3)</italic>, <italic>LATERAL SUPPRESSOR (LAS)</italic>, <italic>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB)</italic>, <italic>JAGGED LATERAL ORGANS (JLO)</italic>, <italic>LATERAL ORGAN FUSION (LOF)</italic>, <italic>HANABA TARANU</italic> (<italic>HAN</italic>), <italic>SUPERMAN (SUP)</italic> and <italic>RABBIT EARS (RBE)</italic>[<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interactions have been found between boundary regulators and genes controlling meristem maintenance or primordia development. For example, <italic>CUC</italic> genes promote SAM formation via the activation of meristem marker <italic>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</italic> (<italic>STM</italic>), and in return, <italic>STM</italic> represses <italic>CUC</italic> expression in the meristem [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic>CUC</italic> genes are also inhibited by primordia marker <italic>ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1)</italic> and <italic>AS2</italic> in the organ primordia [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

In this study, we combined genetic, molecular and biochemical tools to explore interactions between the boundary gene <italic>HAN</italic> and two meristem regulators <italic>(BP</italic> and <italic>PNH)</italic>, and three primordia-specific genes <italic>(PTL</italic>, <italic>JAG</italic> and <italic>BOP1/2)</italic> that function in flower development. We found that <italic>HAN</italic> plays a central role among these seven regulators in the control of petal development.

Further, HAN directly stimulates <italic>CYTOKININ OXIDASE 3</italic> (<italic>CKX3</italic>) expression to modulate cytokinin levels in the boundary.

</title><p>Mutation in <italic>HAN</italic> results in reduced numbers of petals and stamens, and fused sepals [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In contrast to the wild-type flower with four sepals and four petals, the <italic>han-2</italic> mutant has an average of only 3.4 sepals and 2.6 petals in the <italic>Ler</italic> or <italic>Col</italic> background (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A&#x02013;1C</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005479.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In order to explore the potential genetic interactions between <italic>HAN</italic>, meristem regulators, and primordia-specific genes during flower development, we generated double or triple mutant combinations of <italic>han-2</italic> with <italic>bp-1</italic>, <italic>pnh-2</italic>, <italic>ptl-1</italic>, <italic>jag-3</italic> and <italic>bop1 bop2</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005479.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Firstly, we explored the genetic interaction of <italic>HAN</italic> with meristem regulator <italic>BP</italic>. The <italic>bp-1</italic> mutant shows a normal number of floral organs, with downward-pointing flowers and a compact inflorescence (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005479.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The number of petals and sepals was reduced in a <italic>han-2 bp-1</italic> double mutant, with an average of 1.7&#x000b1;0.1 (n = 120) petals (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005479.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005479.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The phenotype of fused sepals is similar to <italic>han-2</italic>. Then, we examined the genetic interaction of <italic>HAN</italic> with <italic>PNH</italic>, whose mutations result in increased numbers of petals. The average petal number was 4.3&#x000b1;0.1 (n = 40) in the <italic>pnh-2</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005479.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <italic>han-2 pnh-2</italic> double mutants have fewer petals than the <italic>han-2</italic> single mutant (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005479.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D&#x02013;S1G Fig</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005479.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Biochemical analysis showed that HAN physically interacts with JAG (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), and a ChIP-PCR assay indicated that HAN directly binds to the promoter of <italic>JAG</italic> and exon of <italic>BOP2</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Therefore, <italic>HAN</italic> directly stimulate the transcription of <italic>JAG</italic> and <italic>BOP2</italic>, and interact with JAG at the protein level (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Given that transcripts of <italic>HAN</italic>, <italic>JAG</italic> and <italic>BOP2</italic> overlap in the boundary regions in the stage 2 flower (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C, 3M and 3Q</xref>), HAN may directly stimulate the transcription of <italic>JAG</italic> and <italic>BOP2</italic> in the boundary region to promote organ primordia development. Consistent with this notion, the serrated sepals in the <italic>jag</italic> mutant were also observed in a <italic>han-1</italic> mutant, which could be due to reduced <italic>JAG</italic> expression, or to elimination of its protein partner, in the <italic>han-1</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Previous finding showed that JAG can directly bind to the promoter of <italic>BOP2</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Our data showed that <italic>BOP2</italic> was significantly reduced in the <italic>jag-3</italic> mutant, indicating that JAG directly stimulates the transcription of <italic>BOP2</italic> in the inflorescence. Given that HAN directly binds to the exon of <italic>BOP2</italic>, HAN promotes the expression of <italic>BOP2</italic> directly or indirectly through <italic>JAG</italic>. Despite HAN also directly binds to the exon of <italic>BOP1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>), transcription of <italic>BOP1</italic> was not changed in the <italic>han-1</italic> mutant, suggesting that additional factors may antagonize the effect of HAN on <italic>BOP1</italic>. In the <italic>bop1 bop2</italic> mutant, <italic>JAG</italic> expression in the inflorescence is down-regulated, in contrast to the upregulation of <italic>JAG</italic> expression in leaves or in the vegetative shoot apex [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], indicating that different interaction modules of <italic>JAG</italic> and <italic>BOP1/2</italic> exist during leaf and flower development.</p><p>Previous data showed that JAG directly binds to the promoter of <italic>PTL</italic> to control petal growth and shape [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and we found that <italic>JAG</italic> repressed the expression of <italic>PTL</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Fig</xref>). Thus, the role of HAN in control of petal number and petal morphology as revealed by the double mutant analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) can be explained by the direct interaction with JAG and BOP2 in the petal boundaries, and thus indirect interaction with PTL during flower development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Notably, ChIP-Seq showed that JAG directly targets <italic>HAN</italic> as well [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, the expression of <italic>HAN</italic> showed no significant change in the <italic>jag-3</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), probably due to autoregulation of <italic>HAN</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>CKX3 and GNC/GNL may act as the direct linkage between HAN and hormone actions</title><p>Our qRT-PCR, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and ChIP-PCR data showed that HAN directly binds to the cytokinin degradation gene <italic>CKX3</italic> and promotes <italic>CKX3</italic> expression (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005479.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005479.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In the <italic>han-1</italic> mutant, the <italic>CKX3</italic> signal intensity was reduced and diffused throughout the FM (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>), resulting in elevated cytokinin content (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Exogenous cytokinin treatment disrupts boundary formation and results in increased floral organ numbers (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G&#x02013;5L</xref>).

Han et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] showed that pAP1::IPT8 (which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme in cytokinin biosynthesis) lines displayed loss of petals [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], while loss of function of both <italic>CKX3</italic> and <italic>CKX5</italic> results in a slight increase in the number of sepals and petals[<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], rather than the reduced floral organ number observed in the <italic>han-1</italic> mutant, suggesting that the distribution of cytokinin rather than the content of cytokinin in the flower is more essential for regulation of petal number, and that HAN regulates flower development via a complex interaction network, with the CKX3-mediated cytokinin pathway only as one branch.</p><p>In addition, the signal intensity of the auxin response marker DR5 was previously shown to be greatly reduced in the <italic>han-2</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], while the IAA level was up-regulated in the <italic>han</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>), suggesting that <italic>HAN</italic> represses auxin biosynthesis and promotes auxin signaling in the inflorescence. Consistent with the antagonistic interaction between auxin and GA [<xref rid="pgen.1005479.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the GA level was significantly decreased in the <italic>han</italic> mutant inflorescence (<xref rid="pgen.1005479.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>).
