Accumulated experimental evidence has demonstrated that infections by viruses are associated with the altered expression profile of miRNAs and their mRNA targets in the host. However, the regulatory network of miRNA-mRNA interactions during viral infection remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed small RNA (sRNA)-seq, degradome-seq and as well as a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to profile the global gene and miRNA expression in soybean following infections by three different <italic>Soybean mosaic virus</italic> (SMV) isolates, L (G2 strain), LRB (G2 strain) and G7 (G7 strain). sRNA-seq analyses revealed a total of 253 soybean miRNAs with a two-fold or greater change in abundance compared with the mock-inoculated control. 125 transcripts were identified as the potential cleavage targets of 105 miRNAs and validated by degradome-seq analyses. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed that total 2679 genes are differentially expressed in response to SMV infection including 71 genes predicted as involved in defense response. Finally, complex miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were derived using the RNAseq, small RNAseq and degradome data. This work represents a comprehensive, global approach to examining virus-host interactions. Genes responsive to SMV infection are identified as are their potential miRNA regulators. Additionally, regulatory changes of the miRNAs themselves are described and the regulatory relationships were supported with degradome data. Taken together these data provide new insights into molecular SMV-soybean interactions and offer candidate miRNAs and their targets for further elucidation of the SMV infection process.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by AAFC Genomics R&#x00026;D Initiative (GRDI), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and Grain Farmers Ontario (GFO).

Among diverse plant pathogens, viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that depend on the host cell to provide the basic machinery in order to complete their life cycle [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Utilization of genetic resistance is considered the most effective and environmental method for the sustainable control of plant pathogens including viruses [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interaction is therefore paramount to developing the next-generation strategies for antiviral resistance in plants. Towards this goal, we launched a comprehensive investigation on the <italic>Soybean mosaic virus</italic> (SMV)-soybean pathosystem using genomic approaches.</p><p>SMV, a member of the genus <italic>Potyvirus</italic> in the <italic>Potyviridae</italic> family, is the most prevalent pathogen that impedes soybean production. The viral genome in this largest family of known plant viruses is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule, approximately 9,600 nucleotides in length. To date, numerous SMV isolates have been reported. Based on their differential responses on susceptible and resistant soybean cultivars, they were classified into seven distinct strains (G1 to G7) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. After extensive screening, three independent dominant resistance genes (<italic>Rsv1</italic>, <italic>Rsv3</italic>, and <italic>Rsv4</italic>) with different SMV strain specificities have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. <italic>Rsv1</italic>, found in soybean cultivar PI96983, confers resistance to the SMV strains G1 to G6 but not to G7 [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In an earlier study, we reported a naturally occurring <italic>Rsv4</italic> resistance-breaking isolate (SMV-LRB) and a closely related non-resistance-breaking isolate (SMV-L) from Canada [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SMV isolates L and LRB belong to the G2 pathotype. Previously, we also explored global gene expression changes of soybean in response to SMV-L infection using microarray [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We found a number of genes involved in defence were downregulated or not affected at the early stages of infection but upregulated at the late stages, indicating that the plant immune responses are suppressed or not activated until late in the infection. We speculated that the delayed defence response may be critical for SMV to establish its systemic infection [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20&#x02013;24 nucleotides in length, single-stranded non-coding RNAs found in all eukaryotes. miRNAs play critical roles in a variety of biological processes such as maintenance of genome integrity, development and feedback mechanisms as well as various biotic and abiotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II) and processed by DICER-LIKE (DCL1) protein in the nucleus from stem-loop structures, then interact with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to efficiently form RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) in the cytoplasm and regulate gene expression by translational inhibition or cleavage of complementary mRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to regulating the expression of endogenous genes, miRNAs are also indispensable during innate immune responses in animals and plants. In human cells, miR-32 effectively restricts the accumulation of the retrovirus primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. miR-122 is specifically expressed and highly abundant in the human liver, and the sequestration of miR-122 into liver cells results in a marked loss of autonomously replicating hepatitis C viral RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In plants, virus infections are often associated with alterations in endogenous miRNAs levels, resulting in changes in the abundance of its target mRNA. The levels of mature miR164, precursor of miR164a and <italic>CUC1</italic> mRNA (a miR164 target) are elevated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants infected by <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> Cg (TMV-Cg) or <italic>Oilseed rape mosaic virus</italic> (ORMV) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A screening of over 53 predicted miRNAs in tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) plants revealed that many of them are upregulated after infection by <italic>Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus</italic> (ToLCNDV) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conversely, some miRNAs in cotton plants are downregulated in response to infection by <italic>Cotton leafroll dwarf virus</italic> (CLRDV) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic>Rice dwarf virus</italic> (RDV) and <italic>Rice stripe virus</italic> (RSV) have distinct impacts on rice small RNA metabolism. RSV infection induces the expression of novel phased miRNAs from several conserved miRNA precursors [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Several Infections of different hosts by <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV, FNY strain) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and <italic>Cymbidum ringspot virus</italic> (CymRSV) suggest a direct link between the host immune response and viral infection [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. More recently, we have shown that the accumulation of miR168 and <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA is significantly induced in <italic>Rsv1</italic> soybean infected by SMV G7, suggesting that both miRNA and siRNA pathways are involved in pathogenesis of SMV G7 in <italic>Rsv1</italic> soybean likely through disruption of AGO1 homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The development and subsequent affordability of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, has led to the identification of a large number of miRNAs and their targets in plants, animals, and viruses. To date, 28,645 hairpin precursor miRNAs, and 35,828 mature miRNAs from 223 species have been annotated and deposited in miRBase (miRBase 21). In <italic>Glycine max</italic>, 573 miRNA precursors and 639 mature miRNAs have been identified from different developmental stages and tissues as well as various biotic and abiotic stress-treated tissues [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Three highly abundant microRNA families (miR1507, miR2109, and miR2118) are known to target conserved domains in the defense-related NB-LRR-encoding genes and trigger the production of trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Soybean miR172c has been demonstrated to modulates both rhizobium infection and nodule organogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], whereas miR393 has been identified to be involved in regulating soybean defense in response to <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Three miRNAs (miR160, miR393 and miR1510) have been shown to be involved in the defense response to SMV infection (SC7 isolate in China) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, most annotations of soybean miRNAs and their targets are derived through computational prediction without experimental validation. The regulatory network of miRNA-mRNA interactions during viral infections including SMV infection still remains largely unknown.</p><p>In this work, we employed sRNA-seq, degradome-seq and transcriptome-seq technologies to study the SMV-soybean pathosystem with the aim of identifying common targets of regulation following infection with three SMV isolates. We conducted an integrated analysis of the resulting high throughout data using both bioinformatics tools including target prediction, GO enrichment analyses and interaction networks and experimental approaches, i.e., stem-loop RT-qPCR, RNA blot, RT-qPCR and RLM-5' RACE. We discovered a group of miRNAs and their mRNA targets that were differentially expressed in response to infections by different SMV isolates/strains and identified common miRNA-mRNA regulatory interactions during SMV infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Common and Unique miRNAs Are Differential Expressed in Response to Infection by Three Different SMV Isolates</title><p>To understand the role of soybean miRNAs during SMV infection, we profiled the expression of miRNAs following infection with different strains of SMV in the susceptible soybean cultivar Williams 82 at 14 days post inoculation (dpi). At this time point, the systemic leaves of infected plants showed typical viral symptoms, consistent with our previous observations [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Fifteen soybean plants infected by three different isolates/strains or mock-inoculated plants were pooled for RNA extraction and small RNA cDNA library construction. We sequenced four small RNA cDNA libraries (G2-L, G2-LRB, G7 and mock control) using the Illumina deep sequencing technology. After trimming the adapter sequences and removal of low quality reads, a total of 28,135,511 reads were obtained. These reads were mapped to the soybean genome (GLYMA1, Ensembl) and aligned to the known miRNA genes in soybean (miRBase 21) using the Strand NGS software (Strand Life Sciences, version 2.1) following the small RNA alignment and small RNA analysis pipeline. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s005">S1 Table</xref>, about 50% reads could be matched perfectly to the soybean genome. This resulted in more than 1.5 million distinct genome-matching small RNA sequences (sRNA-seq) per library. The sRNA-seq from each library was also mapped to each of the 20 soybean chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s005">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the involvement of miRNA in SMV infection, miRNAs were identified that showed differential expression in soybean plants infected with one of three SMV isolates (G2-L, G2-LRB, and G7) compared to the mock control. A total of 253 soybean miRNAs, including both sense and antisense forms of miRNAs (-5p and -3p) which originated from the same predicted precursor and representing 97 families, were differentially regulated by at least a two-fold change [upregulated, Log<sub>2</sub> (FC) &#x02265; +1.0; downregulated, Log<sub>2</sub> (FC) &#x02264;-1.0; quantile normalized raw counts normalized to million mapped miRNA reads] compared to mock-inoculated controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s006">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g001">Fig 1</xref>). 39 miRNAs were identified as being significantly upregulated unique to G2-LRB infection, compared to only 13 and 25 uniquely upregulated miRNAs associated with G2-L and G7 infections, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). 28 downregulated miRNAs were unique to G2-LRB infection, in contrast to only 5 and 9 downregulated miRNAs in G2-L and G7 infections, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). A total of 55 common miRNAs were differentially expressed in soybeans infected by all the three SMV isolates, including 40 upregulated (72.7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and 15 downregulated (27.3%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

Several recent studies have revealed that the miR482/miR2118 superfamily in tomato, soybean and <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, targets numerous NB-LRRs defense genes at the conserved P-loop-encoding motif [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, in chickpea (<italic>Cicer arietinum</italic>), miR2118 is upregulated in response to wilt infection with the fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, it is downregulated after infection by the fungus <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> in cotton [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In tomato, miR482 is downregulated in leaves infected with CMV, <italic>Turnip crinkle virus</italic> (TCV) and <italic>Tobacco rattle virus</italic> (TRV) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, we found that miR2118a/b-5p was highly upregulated, whereas miR482a-5p was downregulated upon infections by any of the three isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We also checked antisense strand miRNAs (-3p) as many such miRNAs are accumulated at high levels in RSV-infected rice plants [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We found that SMV infection enhanced the accumulation of miRNAs-3p in some miRNA families, but not their corresponding miRNAs-5p. These included miRNAs-3p members of four miRNA families, i.e., miR160 (miR160a), miR171 (miR171b and miR171i), miR394 (miR394a and miR394b) and miR408 (miR408a and miR408c) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s006">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). For example, miR4376-3p was significantly induced by SMV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s006">S2 Table</xref>), which was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Its corresponding miR4376-5p, however, did not show any obvious changes, compared to the mock control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In tomato, miR4376 regulates the expression of an auto-inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (<italic>ACA10</italic>) during reproductive growth [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The <italic>ACA10</italic> transcript in soybean does not contain a miR4376 target site and it would be interesting to determine if this transcript is regulated by miR4376 in soybean. Interestingly, GLYMA05g01180, a ribosomal protein <italic>S4</italic> gene was predicted to be a target of miR4376-3p. We further found that GLYMA05g01180 expression was specifically downregulated by miR4376-3p and a cleavage product was detected in soybean plants infected by each of the three isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The cleavage site in the miR4376-3p binding region was validated by 5' RACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), suggesting a possible role for miR4376-3p in SMV infection. Therefore, like sense strand miRNAs, antisense strand miRNAs may also exert regulatory roles by directing the cleavage of their target mRNAs during viral infection.</p><fig id="pone.0150582.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0150582.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Stem-loop RT-qPCR analysis of miRNA expression in response to infection by three SMV isolates.</title><p>Small RNAs fractions (&#x02264; 200 nt) derived from SMV-infected and mock-inoculated plants were isolated at 14 dpi.

G2-LRB infection resulted in the highest number of unique DEMs (39 upregulated and 28 downregulated), suggesting that G2-LRB strain resulted in the enrichment of a larger number of DEMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s006">S2 Table</xref>). Some miRNAs (miR5770a/b, miR5037c and miR862b) were found to be significantly upregulated only by G2-LRB infection, but not by G2-L and G7 infection. In addition, members of the widely conserved miR390 family (miR390a/b/c/d/f/g) that triggers tasiRNA biogenesis for an auxin-responsive regulatory network [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], were significantly downregulated only during G2-LRB infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s006">S2 Table</xref>). According to SL-RT-qPCR analysis, the accumulation of some antisense miRNAs-3p (miR160a-3p, miR394a-3p and miR408c-3p) were specifically enhanced during G2-L and G2-LRB infection, whereas their corresponding miRNAs-5p did not show any obvious changes compared to the mock control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The miR393k-5p was highly induced by G2-L and G7 infection, but not by G2-LRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Furthermore, the accumulation of miR171j-5p and miR164c-5p were profoundly increased only during G2-L and G7 infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g003">Fig 3</xref>). An in-depth analysis of more than 31 million degradome reads from four PARE libraries resulted in identification of 125 transcripts targeted by 26 miRNA families (105 members) under a strict filter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s009">S5 Table</xref>). Among these, some were found to be involved in regulation of transcription such as the HD-ZIP family transcription factor (<italic>GLYMA11G20520</italic>.<italic>1</italic>), GRAS family transcription factor (<italic>GLYMA01G18040</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) and nuclear transcription factor Y (<italic>GLYMA18G07890</italic>.<italic>2</italic>). Some plant defense-related genes such as leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family genes (<italic>GLYMA04G39741</italic>.<italic>1</italic> and <italic>GLYMA13G27540</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) and TIR-NBS-LRR resistance genes (<italic>GLYMA04G39741</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) were also identified in the degradome-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s009">S5 Table</xref>). Moreover, 6 transcripts targeted by miR166i, miR167c, miR169a, miR171k, miR482a and miR4376 respectively were selected for experimental validation by RLM-5' RACE assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Overall, these observations support the accuracy of the sRNA-seq and degradome-seq analysis. Although the roles of common and strain/isolate-specific DEMs requires further investigation, which is beyond the scope of the current study, our results suggest that in addition to shared biological process occurring in infection by three different isolates, the strain/isolate-specific DEMs signatures are associated with the distinct pathogenesis of SMV strains/isolates.</p><p>High-throughput transcriptome-seq provides a powerful approach to identify global transcriptional responses to virus infection. Our transcriptome analysis of the host transcriptional response to SMV infection demonstrated that virus infection alters the expression of numerous DEGs, and these DEGs show transcriptional responses specific to SMV infection with different strains. The analysis of more than 25 million of RNA-seq sequences from four transcriptome libraries resulted in 2679 DEGs responsive to SMV infection with three isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s011">S7 Table</xref>). Among these, 322 upregulated and 300 downregulated DEGs have common expression during SMV infection with all three isolates in comparison with the mock-inoculated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). In turn, there were 346 upregulated and 345 downregulated DEGs only affected during G2-LRB infection but not during G2-L and G7 infection, suggesting that G2-LRB infection induces a more vigorous host response associated with higher number of DEGs. Of the 2679 DEGs, 71 DEGs including 52 <italic>NB-LRR</italic> genes and 10 oxidative stress associated encoding genes are involved in plant defense response to pathogens using GO enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150582.s012">S8 Table</xref>). Based on the results from RT-qPCR analysis, a GRAS family transcription factor (<italic>GLYMA01G18040</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) was highly induced only by G2-L infection, but not by G2-LRB and G7 infection, and a HD-ZIP family gene (<italic>GLYMA11G20520</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) was downregulated only by G7 infection. In addition, a soybean translation initiation factor eIF4e (<italic>GLYMA10G27570</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) considered to be required for virus infection was downregulated during SMV infection with any isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g007">Fig 7</xref>). A ribosomal protein S4 gene (<italic>GLYMA05g01180</italic>) was identified as a novel target by miR4376-3p in this study and was downregulated by infections with any of the isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g007">Fig 7</xref>), suggesting that the interaction plays a key role in SMV infection. An enrichment analysis of GO molecular function provided further support for the heightened response initiated by G2-LRB infection. The G2-LRB isolate had the most unique enriched terms as well as the most enriched terms overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g008">Fig 8</xref>). All isolates had uniquely enriched terms highlighting the differences in the plants response to their infection. The nine enriched terms represented by the DEGs commonly after infection by any of the isolates points to protein synthesis and modification as the common class of genes affected. Translation (GO:0006412), regulation of translation (GO:006417), biosynthetic process (GO:0009058) and cellular component biogenesis (GO:0044085) enrichment likely point to viral hijacking of the cellular machinery for replication as well as the plants own defense response. Enrichment of metabolic process (GO:0008152) and primary metabolic process (GO:0044238) terms reflect the importance of energy management during viral infection. To manage the increase in energy required due to the upregulation of genes involved in disease defense and protein synthesis, the plant may need to finely tune its metabolic output. These data identified a validated set of transcripts associated and significantly responsive to infection by three different SMV isolates and point to the unique as well as common responses infections triggered by the host. Together they provided a resource of novel targets for further studies aiming to further explore the pathologies of these three SMV isolates as well as universal plant responses to SMV infection.</p><p>Having obtained RNAseq, small RNAseq and degradome data from soybean in response to SMV infection allows us to construct complex regulatory networks that are activated following exposure to the virus. However, these networks hinge on computationally predicted miRNA targeting, degradome-seq does not confirm direct miRNA/mRNA interaction and well characterized soybean proteins are rare. Despite these limitations these networks they can nonetheless provide valuable insight for guiding future research by highlighting possible shared and unique regulatory links between miRNAs and their target mRNAs. Whether considering the total or unique networks activated by infection, the G2-LRB strain consistently resulted in more robust networks with more nodes and edges. Additionally, a likely soybean orthologue of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> eIFiso4E protein appears to be a target during infection by G2-LRB strains [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Currently, most of the characterized recessive resistance genes to viruses encode eukaryotic translation initiation factors including those in lettuce (<italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>), melon (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic>), tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>), pepper (<italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>), barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>), pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic>) and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The large observed network is consistent with the relatively higher numbers of DEGs and DEMs observed following G2-LRB infection compared to the other two isolates and is likely due to the relative higher pathogenicity of the isolate. Previous work has revealed that a single amino acid substitution in the P3 protein of G2-LRB enables it to break SMV <italic>Rsv4</italic> resistance [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The G2-L isolate lacks this mutation and is an avirulent determinant for <italic>Rsv4</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The SMV G7 isolate, however, is virulent in the <italic>Rsv1</italic> soybean genotype, which confers extreme resistance against most SMV strains [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Genome wide analyses of miRNAs and their targets can yield thousands of significantly dynamic loci. Generating hypotheses from such complex data is a difficult task. Constructing regulatory networks using miRNA and target data allowed for data distillation and easier interpretation. In order to further narrow the candidate list, miRNAs and target transcripts responsive to infections by all isolates were identified. The resulting network was surprisingly simple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150582.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The shared regulatory network activated in response to all SMV strains found a majority of targets likely involved in protein synthesis and modification. A previous study analysing transcript abundance following SMV infection at 14 dpi similarly found a high number of transcripts predicted to have a role in protein synthesis and translation [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These nodes represent the most promising candidates for future research as they represent regulatory connections conserved in infections by any isolate. While these genes are not characterized in soybean, orthologues in model species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may provide a clue to their role in SMV infection. <italic>GLYMA08G39110</italic> is a likely ortholog of <italic>AT1G10760</italic> (<italic>SEX1</italic>) which encodes an &#x003b1;-glucan, water dikinase required for starch degradation [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>SEX1</italic> gene affect transitory starch turnover and have a deep impact on plant development. In the null mutant, starch accumulates 5 times more than that in wild type plants. Moreover, mutant plants are massively compromised in growth [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The relationship between viral infection, metabolic changes and pyruvate kinases has been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. SMV infection could actively promote starch hydrolysis to meet its reproductive energy demands. The aspartic protease <italic>GLYMA11G03500</italic> could also play an important role during SMV infection. In rice, an aspartic protease-reporter construct shows an increase in activity following inoculation with <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV). A knockout mutant is more susceptible to the virus [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the network, 3 of the 4 four targets are upregulated. Typically miRNA have a negative effect of target transcript there is evidence suggesting that some miRNAs could upregulate gene expression in specific cell types and conditions with distinct transcripts and proteins [<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150582.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. There may also be additional regulatory factors beyond miRNAs involved in regulating these genes and the cumulative effect is represented here. However, these findings suggest potential key targets of SMV infection, both target genes as well as their miRNA regulators, specific to the three SMV isolates as well as ones common to all. As most of our identified targets are uncharacterized in soybean, this work identifies a wealth of opportunities for future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Soybean Cultivar, Virus Strains, Inoculation and Detection</title><p>Soybean [<italic>Glycine Max</italic> (L.)
