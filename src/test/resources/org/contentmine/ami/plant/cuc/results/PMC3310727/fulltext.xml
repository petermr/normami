<italic>EMBRYONIC FLOWER1</italic> (<italic>EMF1</italic>) is a plant-specific gene crucial to Arabidopsis vegetative development. Loss of function mutants in the <italic>EMF1</italic> gene mimic the phenotype caused by mutations in Polycomb Group protein (PcG) genes, which encode epigenetic repressors that regulate many aspects of eukaryotic development. In Arabidopsis, Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), made of PcG proteins, catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) and PRC1-like proteins catalyze H2AK119 ubiquitination. Despite functional similarity to PcG proteins, EMF1 lacks sequence homology with known PcG proteins; thus, its role in the PcG mechanism is unclear. To study the EMF1 functions and its mechanism of action, we performed genome-wide mapping of EMF1 binding and H3K27me3 modification sites in Arabidopsis seedlings. The EMF1 binding pattern is similar to that of H3K27me3 modification on the chromosomal and genic level. ChIPOTLe peak finding and clustering analyses both show that the highly trimethylated genes also have high enrichment levels of EMF1 binding, termed EMF1_K27 genes. EMF1 interacts with regulatory genes, which are silenced to allow vegetative growth, and with genes specifying cell fates during growth and differentiation. H3K27me3 marks not only these genes but also some genes that are involved in endosperm development and maternal effects. Transcriptome analysis, coupled with the H3K27me3 pattern, of EMF1_K27 genes in <italic>emf1</italic> and PRC2 mutants showed that EMF1 represses gene activities via diverse mechanisms and plays a novel role in the PcG mechanism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic repressors maintaining developmental states in eukaryotic organisms. Plant PcG proteins are expected to be general epigenetic repressors; however, their overall impact on growth and differentiation and their mechanism of repression are still unclear. Here we identified several thousand target genes of the EMBRYONIC FLOWER 1 (EMF1) protein, which shares no sequence homology with known PcG proteins. EMF1 regulates developmental phase transitions as well as specifies cell fates during vegetative development. Trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and ubiqutination of lysine 119 of histone H2A are carried out by different PcG protein complexes. EMF1 is required for both histone modifications on genes specifying stem cell fate in plants, thus revealing a novel role of EMF1 in linking the PcG protein complexes. Our results have important implications for the evolution of PcG regulatory mechanisms.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic repressors implicated in various developmental and cellular processes <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

Because FIE is required during seed development and <italic>fie</italic> mutants are embryo-lethal, we used a transgenic line that expresses <italic>FIE</italic> only during the seed development stage to recover homozygous <italic>fie</italic> seedlings <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Kinoshita1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Relative to two-week old WT, plants impaired in each of these three genes have no petioles and rosette leaves, a short hypocotyl, and oval shaped cotyledons. <italic>emf2</italic> and plants impaired in <italic>FIE</italic> are similar in phenotype. The <italic>emf1</italic> allele used in this study, <italic>emf1-2</italic>, is a strong allele with a more severe phenotype than <italic>emf2</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1002512-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002512-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

This 84&#x00025; H3K27me3 reduction is consistent with an earlier study <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Bouyer1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, in which a 75&#x00025; loss in a different <italic>FIE</italic>-impaired transgenic plant was reported. The loss of H3K27me3 in <italic>fie</italic> mutant seedlings indicates that H3K27me3 requires a functional PRC2 complex. The moderate decline of H3K27me3 in <italic>emf2</italic> could be due to partial replacement of EMF2 function by its homolog, VRN2 <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Chanvivattana1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Schubert1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The partial requirement for EMF1 shows that H3K27me3 is less dependent on EMF1 than on PRC2, indicating a site-specific EMF1-dependent H3K27 trimethylation. Nevertheless, 75&#x00025; of the genes with reduced H3K27me3 in <italic>emf1</italic> have reduced H3K27me3 in <italic>emf2</italic> and <italic>fie</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002512-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that trimethylation on these genes requires coordinated action by EMF1 and PRC2.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Genes highly trimethylated on H3K27 and enriched for EMF1 binding</title><p>Because peak calling necessarily involves arbitrary cutoffs, we supplemented the ChIPOTLe analysis that generated the H3K27me3 peaks by an unsupervised <italic>k-means</italic> clustering algorithm (<italic>k</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002512-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel).

The promoter regions of this highly trimethylated cluster of genes show minimal H3K27me3 modification, while it is highly enriched in the transcribed region. H3K27me3 enrichment is highest around the TSS, then declines slightly but is maintained throughout the 3 kb of the transcribed region. As expected, H3K27me3 enrichment is reduced in all three mutants, nearly absent in <italic>fie</italic> and partially lost in <italic>emf2</italic> and <italic>emf1</italic>. Despite the reduction in the mutants, the H3K27me3 pattern across the gene remains remarkably similar to WT. The EMF1 binding pattern of these highly methylated genes is similar to their H3K27me3 modification pattern in that EMF1 binds primarily the chromatin of the transcribed, rather than the promoter, region. However, EMF1 binding in this cluster of highly methylated genes shows a precipitous drop from the peak of binding at the TSS in the 3&#x02032; direction: the major binding is within 1 kb of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002512-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Results from the <italic>k-means</italic> clustering algorithm and the ChIPOTle method are consistent.

To this end we generated genome-wide maps of EMF1 binding, and examined H3K27me3 modification and transcription on the EMF1-bound genes in WT, <italic>emf1</italic>, and plants impaired in PRC2 components. Analysis of a large number of target genes allowed us to ascertain a wide range of EMF1 functions. The data suggest that EMF1 regulates gene activity via diverse mechanisms. How the EMF1-bound, but unmethylated, genes are regulated is unclear at this moment. But the EMF1_K27 genes are most likely regulated via the classical PcG mechanism. Recent findings indicate that PRCs have multiple potential modes of action that go beyond the classical hierarchical model of synergistic effects of PRC2 and PRC1 <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Majewski1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

To further characterize the role of EMF1 in the PcG-mediated epigenetic mechanism, we focused our investigation on the EMF1_K27 genes, studying the requirement of EMF1 for H3K27me3 and the impact of EMF1 and PRC2 on gene expression.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>EMF1 functions as a Polycomb Group protein</title><p>Our genome-wide study provided new lines of evidence that support EMF1 acting via the PcG mechanism. First, EMF1 interacts mostly with euchromatic sites located on all 5 chromosomes, a pattern similar to H3K27 trimethylation. Second, on the genic level, the EMF1 binding pattern mimics that of the H3K27me3 in binding the transcribed, not the promoter, region with the peak binding activity at the 5&#x02032; TSS. Third, EMF1 represses the seed and flower development genes and cell fate determination genes that are also modified by H3K27me3. Fourth, H3K27 trimethylation on EMF1-bound genes is mostly dependent on PRC2 and gene expression is coordinately regulated by EMF1 and PRC2. These findings demonstrate that, for genes that are highly enriched for EMF1 binding and H3K27me3, EMF1 functions in the PcG mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Role of EMF1 in the PcG mechanism</title><p>We investigated H3K27me3 dependency on EMF1 binding and found two groups of genes. Group I genes are richer in transcription factors and their repression is more dependent on EMF1 and PRC2 than Group II genes. Most importantly, Group I genes are dependent on EMF1 for H3K27me3 modification, while Group II genes are not. For Group I genes, which require EMF1 for K27me3, EMF1 may act prior to, or as a member of, PRC2 to trimethylate H3K27. For Group II genes that do not require EMF1 for H3K27me3, EMF1 may have a PRC1 function, or may be unrelated to PcG action. Since many Group II genes require PRC2 for H3K27me3, EMF1 is likely to act via the PcG mechanism, functioning downstream of H3K27trimethylation, as does PRC1.</p><p>The characteristics of the four Arabidopsis RING-finger proteins, AtRING1A, AtRING1B, AtBMI1A, and AtBMI1B, are consistent with their functioning like the mammalian PRC1 uibquitin ligase, which monoubiquitinates H2AK119 <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002512-Bratzel1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

Coupling EMF1 with H3K27 trimethylation could have led to an enhanced targeting of genes in development. The repression of flower development, which effectively lengthens the vegetative phase, coupled with elaborating plant architecture through the regulation of hormone and signaling genes, may have been instrumental in the evolution of organisms with multiple developmental phases and diverse signaling processes. This is suggested by the progressive increase in the representation of genes involved in transcription and developmental processes from the H3K27me3 modified genes to the EMF1_K27 to Group I genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002512-g005">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002512.s009">Table S5</xref>). The fact that EMF1_K27 genes are highly enriched with H3K27me3 and EMF1 binding suggests an emphasis on this epigenetic mechanism through robust retention of repressive chromatin during cell differentiation.
