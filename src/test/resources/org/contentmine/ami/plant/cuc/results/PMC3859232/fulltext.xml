It is acquired during seed filling and lost just after germination. However, in many species, a germinated seed can regain DT under adverse conditions such as osmotic stress. The genes, proteins and metabolites that are required to establish this DT is referred to as the desiccome. It includes both a range of protective mechanisms and underlying regulatory pathways that remain poorly understood. As a first step toward the identification of the seed desiccome of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, using updated microarrays we characterized the overlapping transcriptomes associated with acquisition of DT in developing seeds and the re-establishment of DT in germinated seeds using a polyethylene glycol treatment (&#x02212;1.7 MPa). The resulting list contained 740 and 2829 transcripts whose levels, respectively, increased and decreased with DT. Fourty-eight transcription factors (TF) were identified including <italic>MtABI3</italic>, <italic>MtABI5</italic> and many genes regulating flowering transition and cell identity. A promoter enrichment analysis revealed a strong over-representation of ABRE elements together with light-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements. In <italic>Mtabi5 Tnt1</italic> insertion mutants, DT could no longer be re-established by an osmotic stress. Transcriptome analysis on <italic>Mtabi5</italic> radicles during osmotic stress revealed that 13 and 15% of the up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively, are mis-regulated in the mutants and might be putative downstream targets of <italic>MtABI5</italic> implicated in the re-establishment of DT. Likewise, transcriptome comparisons of the desiccation sensitive <italic>Mtabi3</italic> mutants and hairy roots ectopically expressing <italic>MtABI3</italic> revealed that 35 and 23% of the up-regulated and down-regulated genes are acting downstream of <italic>MtABI3</italic>. Our data suggest that ABI3 and ABI5 have complementary roles in DT. Whether DT evolved by co-opting existing pathways regulating flowering and cellular phase transition and cell identity is discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ABI3</kwd><kwd>ABI5</kwd><kwd>ABA</kwd><kwd>desiccation tolerance</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>seed</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd><italic>Medicago truncatula</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="64"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="10278"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding osmotic stress responses is one of the most important topics in plant science as this stress causes adverse effects on crop yield and quality (Hirayama and Shinozaki, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). For example, the recent drought waves that occurred in Europe in 2003 and in most of the USA in 2012 caused an estimated 30% reduction in primary productivity (Ciais et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Claeys and Inz&#x000e9;, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). With the prospect of climate changes that are expected to worsen water limitations in the future, these figures suggest that major progress in understanding how plants cope with drought stress remains to be made. Given these agricultural challenges, it is remarkable that there exist biological mechanisms that allow complete desiccation with loss of viability (Hoekstra et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Moore et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Leprince and Buitink, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Gechev et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Gaff and Oliver, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Desiccation tolerant seeds and leaves have acquired mechanisms that enable them to safely experience decreasing water potentials at which drought tolerant tissues are barely surviving (i.e., &#x0003e; &#x02212;3 MPa for cell protoplasts). Therefore, it is argued that understanding the molecular processes leading to desiccation tolerance (DT) in seeds and resurrection plants might help the design and production of drought tolerant crops (Bartels and Sunkar, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Moore et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Rodriguez et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Oliver et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gechev et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The desiccome can be referred to as the set of genes, proteins and metabolites that are required for DT (Leprince and Buitink, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). They are part of the protective mechanisms that can be grouped in at least three types that act synergistically (for reviews see Hoekstra et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Tunnacliffe and Wise, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Moore et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; M&#x000f6;nke et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Leprince and Buitink, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Gaff and Oliver, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>): (1) protection by stabilization of membranes and proteins by non-reducing sugars, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and heat shock protein (HSP), (2) protection against oxidative damage by a range of antioxidant compounds such as tocopherols, glutathione, together with a coordinated response of metabolism during drying and (3) protection against structural stresses imposed by drying such as cell wall modification, reorganization of endomembranes and cytoskeleton, vacuolization and chromatin condensation. The desiccome also includes the regulatory mechanisms and signaling pathways controlling the induction of these protective mechanisms leading to DT. However, these pathways are still poorly understood.</p><p><italic>Abscisic acid</italic> (<italic>ABA</italic>) has been long known to play a prominent regulatory role in DT. In several species of resurrection plants, exogenous ABA induces DT [reviewed by Gaff and Oliver (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>)] whereas in seeds, genetic screens for ABA insensitivity during germination has led to the discovery of <italic>abscisic acid insensitive 3</italic> (<italic>abi3</italic>) mutants. Severe alleles of <italic>abi3</italic> mutants of several species, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Ooms et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) and <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (Delahaie et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) produce desiccation-sensitive seeds and have reduced expression of many genes related to DT like LEA genes. An ABI3 ortholog has been found to activate LEA genes in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> (Yotsui et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), suggesting that ABI3 is part of an evolutionarily conserved regulatory network. <italic>ABI3</italic> encodes a transcription factor belonging to the B3 domain-containing family and its function in the ABA signaling pathway in seeds is well characterized (Cutler et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hauser et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Nakashima and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Transcriptional targets of ABI3 have been identified based either on transcript analysis in loss-of-function mutants or over-expressing transgenics (Nakashima et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) or through genome wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (M&#x000f6;nke et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). They include oleosins, LEA proteins and storage proteins. However, the experimental set up of these studies did not consider a putative link with DT.</p><p>To date, the ABA-signaling pathway leading to DT is mainly inferred from the knowledge gained from genetic and biochemical studies in drought tolerance in vegetative tissues and seed development. Indeed, the backbone of the ABA core signaling pathway, including positive and negative regulators involved in the response to osmotic stress in vegetative tissues, is very similar to that involved in seed maturation during which DT is acquired (Finkelstein et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Fujita et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Hauser et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Nakashima and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In seeds and seedlings, basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TF) belonging to the ABA Responsive Element Binding Factors (AREB/ABF) and ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) clade represent key TF controlling ABA-responsive gene expression such as LEA genes by interacting with ABA responsive regulatory elements (ABRE) in their promoter region. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, promoters of genes with transcript levels that accumulate during maturation drying and that are stored in the dry seeds exhibit an enrichment in ABRE elements (Nakabayashi et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). ABI5 is considered as a crucial player in ABA signaling (Fujita et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). ABI5 appears to be courted by multiple proteins, thereby forming a complex interactome (Lindemose et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). There is also a large body of evidence suggesting that ABI5 forms a complex with ABI3 to regulate the expression of downstream genes with ABI3 acting as an accessory enhancer of transcription (Nakamura et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Lindemose et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It is suggested that such interaction occurs only during seed maturation (Finkelstein et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). ABI5 exerts a positive regulation of <italic>EM1</italic> and <italic>EM6</italic> genes (Nakamura et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Finkelstein et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) both encoding LEA proteins whose abundance correlates with DT in developing and germinating seeds of <italic>Medicago</italic> (Boudet et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chatelain et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, null alleles of ABI5 apparently produce desiccation-tolerant seeds in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. During seedling establishment, ABI5 controls an ABA- or osmotic stress induced post-germinative growth arrest that is accompanied by an increased drought tolerance (Lopez-Molina et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Therefore, the precise role of ABI5 in DT, if any, remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the regulatory components involved in DT in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> seeds by revisiting the transcriptome changes associated with the acquisition of DT during seed maturation and the re-establishment of DT in emerged radicles upon an osmotic treatment using a PEG solution at &#x02212;1.7 MPa (Buitink et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Verdier et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We used an updated Nimblegen slide containing the almost complete <italic>M. truncatula</italic> genome. One of the identified TF that was further characterized for its role in DT was <italic>MtABI5</italic>. New putative ABI5-regulated target genes that are involved in DT were identified from a transcriptome analysis. In addition, to identify ABI3-related genes involved in DT, we also took advantage of recently obtained transcriptome data on <italic>Medicago Mtabi3</italic> seeds and hairy roots ectopically expressing <italic>MtABI3</italic>. The comparison of these five transcriptomes provides insights into the desiccome that is regulated by ABI3 and ABI5 and identifies new regulators that might play a role in DT in seeds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and physiology</title><p>Plants of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> ssp. <italic>tricycla</italic> (R108) were grown in a sterile mix of vermiculite and soil in a growth chamber at 24&#x000b0;C/21&#x000b0;C, 16 h photoperiod at 200 &#x003bc;M m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.

Two <italic>M. truncatula</italic> mutants with <italic>Tnt1</italic> insertions in the <italic>MtABI5</italic> gene (NF4383, hereafter referred to as <italic>Mtabi5-1</italic> and NF3376, <italic>Mtabi5-2</italic>) were obtained from the Samuel Noble Foundation (Oklahoma, USA). <italic>Tnt1</italic> insertions in both mutants were verified by PCR according to Delahaie et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) using forward and reverse primers ATGGTGGTAAGAGAAGGTGAGAT and AGCAGCAAGATCTAGAGCCAGA, respectively. Mutant and wild-type lines (R108) were multiplied in a growth chamber according to Chatelain et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).

ABA was dissolved in methanol prior to dilution in water. Control seeds were imbibed in the MeOH concentration corresponding to the highest ABA concentration (0.5% MeOH). Germination was scored after 14 days.</p><p>The re-establishment of DT after germination was performed according to Buitink et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Germinated seeds with a protruded radicle length of 2.7&#x02013;2.9 mm (thereafter referred to as 2.7 mm) were selected and submitted to an osmotic treatment by incubation in a PEG 8000 solution (&#x02212;1.7 MPa) at 10&#x000b0;C in the dark. After 72 h, seeds were removed from the PEG solution and rinsed thoroughly. Three replicates of 50 radicles before and after PEG treatment from WT and <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants were excised and frozen for RNA extraction. DT of germinated, untreated and PEG-treated germinated seeds was assessed by drying 50 seeds for each condition for 3 days at 20&#x000b0;C under an air flow at 42% RH. Radicles were considered desiccation-tolerant when they resumed growth upon re-imbibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatic analyses</title><p>A blast was performed on the <italic>Medicago</italic> IMGAG Mt3.5.1 version using the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ABI5 amino acid sequence (At2g36270.1) to retrieve homologous genes (score <italic>e</italic> &#x0003c; 1E-20).

To identify genes that are differentially expressed during the acquisition of DT, transcript levels were compared between 14 days after pollination (DAP), when seeds are still desiccation sensitive, and 32 DAP, when 100% of the seeds have acquired their DT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Data analysis identified 3626 and 14601 transcripts that increased or decreased at least two-fold, respectively, between 14 and 32 DAP. Next, we characterized the transcriptome in relation to the re-establishment of DT. DT is lost following germination after the radicle is protruded, first in the radicles and then in the cotyledons. However, it is possible to re-establish DT in these protruded radicles by an osmotic stress treatment using a PEG solution at &#x02212;1.7 MPa (Buitink et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Faria et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). We performed a transcriptome analysis on 2.7 mm long protruded radicles before and after 72 h of PEG incubation, corresponding to desiccation sensitive and -tolerant tissues, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Both datasets were compared to each other to identify overlapping transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This resulted in the identification of 740 transcripts that positively correlate with DT (hereafter referred to as the DT-UP list) and 2829 transcripts that are down-regulated when DT is installed (DT-DOWN list) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). It should be noted that some redundancy exists between the probes. Some of them are recognized by the same gene transcript, which can only be removed when the assembly of the <italic>M. truncatula</italic> genome is completed.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Changes in desiccation tolerance (DT) and the associated desiccome in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>.</bold> (<bold>A,B</bold>) Schematic representation of the acquisition of DT during seed maturation (MAT) at the indicated days after pollination (DAP) [<bold>A</bold>, curve taken from Chatelain et al.

Compared to this study, the number of transcripts overlapping between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Medicago</italic> increased from 22 (48 transcripts) to 77% (115) of the total amount of up-regulated genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> during re-establishment of DT and from 13 (49 transcripts) to 50% (139) for the down-regulated genes. These values reinforce the idea that core mechanisms and key regulators involved in DT are conserved across species, despite the fact that whole seeds were used for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and only radicles for <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (Maia et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into the <italic>Medicago</italic> DT-related transcriptome, a GO enrichment analysis was performed using agriGO. Within the up-regulated genes, the main enriched GO terms belonged to three broad categories: developmental processes, endogenous stimuli and external stimuli and stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). A closer look at these GO terms identified categories previously described by Maia et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) in the relation to the re-establishment of DT in germinated seeds, such as post-embryonic development, response to ABA, and response to water deprivation. The latter two GO terms were also enriched in the transcriptome of dehydrating leaves of the resurrection plant <italic>Craterostigma plantagineum</italic> (Rodriguez et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), reinforcing the importance of ABA as a core regulator of DT. Our data also revealed an important and previously un-described category in the DT-UP list, namely &#x0201c;anatomical structure development.&#x0201d; Apart from genes that have been discovered previously in relation to DT, such as LEA genes, oleosins, or 1-cys peroxyredoxin, this GO category revealed genes whose <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologs are involved in the regulation of cell growth, cell formation or identity. This category also contains several probes whose homologs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> impose maternal effects on seed development such as DEMETER (responsible for endosperm maternal-allele-specific hypomethylation at the MEDEA gene) and MATERNAL EFFECT EMBRYO ARREST 11 and 14 (MEE11, MEE14), whose mutants are embryo lethal because of endosperm development arrest (Pagnussat et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). It is long recognized that many seed traits such as weight, germination and even longevity (i.e., survival in the dry state for a period of time) are under the influence of parent-of-origin effects (Bl&#x000f6;dner et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Donohue, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kochanek et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Since the acquisition of DT is essential to complete the plant life cycle, these data raise the intriguing question whether maternal effects might also influence the transcriptional part of the desiccome.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the desiccation tolerant UP list (A) and desiccation tolerant DOWN list (B).</bold> Analysis was performed on the DT-UP and DT-DOWN list from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> using AgriGO with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> TAIR9 background applying a Chi<sup>2</sup> statistical test with the Yekutieli multi-test adjustment method.

NI, not identified</italic>.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Strikingly, 17 TF (35%) with increased transcript levels in relation to DT were homologs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> regulators that are broadly associated with cell fate or cell identity (see italics characters in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). For example, TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E6 (GTE6) regulates differences in leaf patterning between juvenile and mature leaves. PLETHORA 2 (PLT2) is a master regulator of embryonic pattern formation during embryogenesis and root development during seedling growth (Galinha et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 3 (CUC3) regulates embryonic shoot meristem formation and cotyledon boundary specification (Hibara et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). HAT3 controls apical embryo development and meristem function (Turchi et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). GRF5 regulates the promotion and/or maintenance of cell proliferation activity in leaf primordia. In rice, the homolog of WOX11 regulates the activation of crown root emergence and growth (Zhao et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Yet, during the acquisition of DT during maturation and during PEG, the cell cycle activities are repressed (Faria et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Whether these TF participate at the repression of these activities or whether they are necessary to coordinate the resumption of growth and development during rehydration remains to be assessed.</p><p>The <italic>Medicago</italic> TF list also contains homologs of transcriptional activators of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that participate in the precise regulation of the timing of flowering by incorporating temperature or day length information to promote floral transition and flower meristem identity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Among these, we find bHLH80 and bHLH130, respectively, homologs of FLOWERING BHLH 1 and 4 (FBH1 and FBH4), MADS-box protein SVP (homolog of SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE SVP) and Myb-related protein MYB4 (homolog of MYB17) (Gregis et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Jang et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ito et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The implication of regulators integrating light information or controlling flowering was further reinforced by the identification of homologs of CHO1 (CHOTTO1) and SOM (SOMNUS) (Kim et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Yano et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and, in the DT-UP list, the photoreceptor FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F BOX 1(FKF1). Although our analysis is based solely on the comparison of transcript levels, and care should be taken with the interpretation of the data based on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologs, altogether, these findings raise new questions about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of DT and developmental transitions. One such question is whether these regulators could play a role in integrating developmental and environmental signals such as light to maintain irreversible the transition from a desiccation-sensitive to a tolerant stage.</p><p>If DT has integrated regulatory pathways that relay developmental and environmental cues, then this should be revealed in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of promoter genes of the DT-UP list. For 393 out of 740 transcripts of the DT-UP list, promoters could be retrieved using the IMGAG Mt3.5.1 version. The most abundantly represented <italic>cis</italic>-elements were related to ARBRE elements (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>): 213 out of 393 promoters contained ABRE-related sequences (ABRERATCAL). These elements are targets of the bZIP ABI5 or ABRE binding factors, which suggests a role of these TF in DT in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> seeds. Many promoters of the DT-UP genes also contain DRE elements, but they were not significantly over-represented. DRE regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-elements known to regulate ABA-dependent and -independent gene expression in response to osmotic stress and their role in seeds has been suggested (Fujita et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Numerous genes contained <italic>cis</italic>-elements that are related to light mediated regulation/&#x0201c;G box&#x0201d; (GBOXLERBCS), known for binding with GBF, &#x0201c;BoxII&#x0201d; (LREBOXIIPCCHS1), &#x0201c;LRE&#x0201d; (LRENPCABE), and &#x0201c;Sequences Over-Represented in Light-Induced Promoters&#x0201d; (SORLIP4AT). The c<italic>is</italic>-element GBOXLERBCS was also found enriched in the DT transcriptome of PEG-treated germinated seeds of Arabidopis (Maia et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and supports our hypothesis that regulation of DT has adopted regulatory pathways integrating light signals. Two overrepresented <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements were related to auxin, AUXREPSIAA4 and SGBFGMGMAUX28. This is consistent with the observation that several genes involved in cell identity present in the DT-list (PLT2, GRF5, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) mediate auxin responses. Twenty seven genes contained the Sucrose Responsive Element 2 (SURE2), a motif conserved among genes regulated by sucrose (Grierson et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Finally, 27 genes contained a UPRMOTIFIIAT &#x0201c;Motif II,&#x0201d; a conserved UPR (unfolded protein response) cis-acting element in <italic>Arabidopsis genes</italic> coding for stress proteins (Martinez and Chrispeels, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table

In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ABI5 binds to ABRE elements of Em genes whose homologs were found in our DT list (Finkelstein et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Cutler et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). In concert with ABI3, ABI5 is known to regulate post-germinative growth arrest leading to drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings (Lopez-Molina et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). This prompted us to test whether <italic>MtABI5</italic> was a key factor in regulating DT and if so, what its target genes are in the desiccome gene set. Considering that the <italic>Arabidopsis genome</italic> comprises nine genes forming a <italic>ABI5</italic>-homologs subfamily of bZIP TF binding to ABRE elements (Fujita et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), we first determined whether the <italic>Medicago</italic> gene Medtr7g104480 is homologous to ABI5 or other ABI5-like genes. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ABI5 amino acid sequence was blasted against the Mt3.5.1 <italic>Medicago</italic> database and nine sequences were retrieved. A phylogenetic tree was constructed including the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ABI5 sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and confirmed that Medtr7g104480 is indeed the closest homolog to ABI5.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of <italic>abscisic acid insensitive</italic> 5 (<italic>Mtabi5</italic>) mutants of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>.

The <italic>Tnt1</italic> insertions were located at 599 and 1034 bp from the start-codon, respectively, before the bZIP domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). After the production of freshly harvested seeds, the ABA sensitivity of both <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants was tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Like for <italic>abi5</italic> mutants of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Lopez-Molina et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), mature <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds exhibited a strongly reduced sensitivity to ABA. In the presence of 10&#x003bc;M, <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds germinated at 100% whereas germination was fully inhibited in wild type seeds at this concentration.</p><p>Scarified, dry mature seeds of the <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants were all able to germinate when imbibed at 20&#x000b0;C on wet filter paper, indicating that they acquired DT. Next, we tested whether ABI5 was implicated in the re-establishment of DT in sensitive emerged radicles during an osmotic treatment at &#x02212;1.7 MPa using a PEG solution. In germinated wild type seeds, DT of emerged radicles is lost progressively during growth from 1 to 3 mm (Buitink et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Control experiments confirmed that germinated seeds of the <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants were not desiccation tolerant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Furthermore, like germinated untreated wild-type seeds, the germinated <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants started to lose their viability when water content decreased below 1.0 g H<sub>2</sub>O g DW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and decreased sharply below 0.5 g H<sub>2</sub>O g DW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The comparable critical water content between germinated <italic>Mtabi5</italic> and wild type seeds suggests that <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds are not more sensitive to drought. Next, we tested whether germinated <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds exhibiting a 2.7 mm long emerged radicle were able to tolerate the osmotic stress (&#x02212;1.7 MPa) brought by the PEG treatment that is necessary to re-establish DT in wild type seeds. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> shows that after 3 days in PEG, germinated <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds were able to resume growth when transferred into water. However, when germinated, PEG-treated <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds were dried to water contents of 9% (dry weight basis), they were no longer able to resume growth upon rehydration, indicating that the <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds remain desiccation sensitive, and lost their competence to re-establish DT upon osmotic treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Desiccation tolerance is not re-established during PEG treatment in germinated <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds.

Although the temporal acquisition of DT might differ between <italic>Mtabi5</italic> seeds and wild type seeds during seed development, our data suggest that <italic>MtABI5</italic> is much more a critical determinant for DT in seedlings than during maturation. Possibly, there might be redundant pathways in place during maturation that are absent in germinated seedlings. Indeed ABI5 and other bZIP factors of the same class operate with many other TF in a complex combinatorial control of gene expression that is poorly understood (Nakamura et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Lopez-Molina et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Finkelstein et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Cutler et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Lindemose et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Verdier et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the part of the desiccome that is influenced by <italic>MtABI5</italic> during the re-establishment of DT tolerance, a transcriptome analysis was performed on the protruded radicles of germinated <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants before and after the incubation in the PEG solution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). A total of 852 out of the 3626 transcripts with increased levels in the wild type were no longer up-regulated by the PEG treatment in the <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.01 and ratio after PEG/before PEG &#x0003c; 1 or &#x0003e; &#x02212;1). Likewise, out of the 6691 transcript levels that decreased during the PEG treatment in the wild type, 1865 no longer decreased in the <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants. Next, these data were compared to the DT-UP and DT-DOWN lists (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>). 112 of the 740 transcripts (15%) that are present in the DT-UP list were no longer up-regulated in the <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants whereas 23% (677) of the 2829 transcripts of DT-DOWN list were no longer down-regulated. From these data, <italic>MtABI5</italic> seems to play a predominant role as a repressor rather than an activator during the re-establishment of DT. Further work is needed to investigate which of these genes are under the direct regulation of <italic>MtABI5</italic> or modulated downstream of <italic>MtABI5</italic> pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome analysis identifies <italic>MtABI3</italic>-related genes involved in DT</title><p>A recent characterization of Tnt1 <italic>abi3</italic> mutants of <italic>Medicago</italic> demonstrated that like for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Medicago abi3</italic> mutant seeds are desiccation sensitive and contain reduced amount of LEA proteins (Delahaie et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To investigate which genes of the desiccome were regulated directly or acting downstream of <italic>MtABI3</italic>, we took advantage of recently published transcriptome data of developing desiccation-sensitive <italic>Mtabi3</italic> mutant seeds (Verdier et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, GEO database accession GSE44291). These seeds were analyzed at 32 DAP and compared to wild type seeds of the same age, after DT had been acquired (Verdier et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition, we compared this dataset to that of the transcriptome of <italic>Medicago</italic> roots ectopically expressing the genomic sequence of <italic>MtABI3</italic> (<italic>35S::ABI3</italic>, Verdier et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; GEO database accession GSE44291). Amongst the 1151 transcripts with significantly decreased levels in the <italic>Mtabi3</italic> seeds, 249 were present in DT-UP list (i.e., 33% of the list, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>) and 43 were present in the three data sets. Similarly, out 3745 transcripts that increased significantly in the <italic>Mtabi3</italic> seeds, 817 were present in the DT-DOWN list (i.e., 28%) and 39 were found in common between the three data sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>). To further validate the <italic>MtABI3</italic>-mediated expression of DT genes, we verified whether their <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologs were among the list of the experimentally validated targets of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ABI3 regulon (M&#x000f6;nke et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For the 43 up-regulated genes present in all three dataset (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), 19 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologs were identified as part of the regulon of <italic>MtABI3</italic>. Genes in this list encoded LEA proteins and genes involved in seed storage deposition such as oleosins and seed storage proteins. It is noteworthy that transcripts of two cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domain proteins were also identified, one of them being <italic>MtSNF4b</italic>, a subunit of the metabolic regulator SUCROSE NONFERMENTING RELATD KINASE (SnRK1). MtSNF4b plays a role in seed longevity and activation of biotic stress pathways in dormant seeds (Rosnoblet et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Bolingue et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Since M&#x000f6;nke et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) did not investigate targets that are repressed by ABI3, a comparison was impossible (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Venn diagram identifying DT transcripts related to <italic>ABSCISIC ACID 3 (ABI3</italic>) of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>.</bold> Transcripts that were identified in the DT-UP or DT-DOWN lists were compared to those that are differentially expressed in <italic>Mtabi3</italic> seeds at 32 DAP compared to wild type seeds (<italic>Mtabi3</italic> 32 DAP) and to those that are differentially expressed upon ectopic expression of <italic>MtABI3</italic> in hairy roots compared to control.

Among the 27 genes from the DT-UP list that are downstream of both TFs, we noticed three different glutamate-cysteine ligases that catalyze the first and rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH, Noctor et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>gsh1</italic> mutants confer a recessive embryo-lethal phenotype and it was suggested that the autonomous synthesis of GSH in the embryo was necessary for proper seed maturation (Cairns et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). During drying, the resurrection plant <italic>Sporobolus stapfianus</italic> exhibited an important increase in GSH and &#x003b3;-glutamyl amino acids compared to the desiccation-sensitive <italic>Sporobulus pyramidalis</italic> (Oliver et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Thus, GSH might represent a key antioxidant involved for the survival in the dry state. A RT-qPCR study validated their expression level (Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>). Surprisingly, LEA transcripts were found to be regulated only by ABI3; in the <italic>Mtabi5</italic> mutants they increased in a comparable way to the wild type radicles (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>). Four TFs were related to both <italic>MtABI3</italic> and <italic>MtABI5</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). It is noteworthy that homologs of two of them mediate light responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; FBH1 and a gene bearing high homology to LZF1 (LIGHT-REGULATED ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 1). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, LZF1 is a positive regulator functioning in de-etiolation and the accumulation of anthocyanin (Chang et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>The pathway downstream of ABI3 is more affected compared to ABI5, representing, respectively, 30% (222 transcripts) of the DT-UP list and 23% (648 transcripts) of DT-DOWN list. Biological processes that were overrepresented in the ABI3-related gene list were &#x0201c;response to <italic>abscisic acid</italic> stimulus,&#x0201d; including ABA responsive genes such as homologs of RD26 or PROTEIN-L-ISOASPARTATE METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (PIMT1), playing a role in protein repair after seed ageing (Og&#x000e9; et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The GO term &#x0201c;response to heat&#x0201d; included heat stress associated proteins, HSP (HSP101, sHPs) and HSF, whereas the GO term &#x0201c;multicellular organismal development&#x0201d; contained ABI3 targets, such as storage reserve proteins, 1-cys-peroxiredoxin and LEA genes.</p><p>Out of the 85 transcripts corresponding to <italic>Medicago</italic> genes that were identified as up-regulated via <italic>MtABI5</italic>, only few were annotated (Supplemental Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>). Many of them corresponded to sequences implicated in transcriptional regulation (DNA polymerases, RNA processing) and post-transcriptional regulation (ubiquitin-related). Several bHLH TFs were identified, namely bHLH135 (PRE5), bHLH84, and bHLH130 (FBH4). The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FBH4 positively regulates CONSTANS transcription for photoperiodic flowering together with FBH1 (Ito et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>A GO enrichment analysis on the DT-DOWN list revealed that the main biological processes for which transcripts are down-regulated by both TFs are cell cycle, secondary metabolic processes and specific kinase or receptor signaling pathways (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The ABI5-related dataset showed a highly significant overrepresentation of processes related to cell division and actin cytoskeleton organization. This category goes together with the previously mentioned <italic>CUC3</italic> TF whose expression is affected by ABI5 and involved in the repression of cell division (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Another biological processes enriched in the ABI5-related probe list is &#x0201c;defense response,&#x0201d; including genes involved in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and programmed cell death. The GO analysis of the overrepresented biological processes of the down-regulated transcripts that are related to ABI3 is complementary to that of the ABI5-related list (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). ABI3 appears to regulate biological processes involved in &#x0201c;DNA replication,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;cell wall modification&#x0201d; and genes involved in microtubule-based processes. Interestingly, this goes together with the ABI3-dependent up-regulation of PHS1 (PROPYZAMIDE-HYPERSENSITIVE 1), involved in phosphorylation cascades that control the dynamics of cortical microtubules in plant cells (Naoi and Hashimoto, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). <italic>Phs1</italic> mutants are hypersensitive to ABA. In addition, other biological processes were related to primary metabolic process, such as fatty acid biosynthetic process, carbohydrate metabolic process, and lipid biosynthetic process.

We are aware that the hypotheses described in this study are based solely on steady-state transcript levels and inferred from homologous genes characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Therefore, more work is necessary to define gene functions and dissect the complex regulation of gene expression. In addition, post-transcriptional and post-translational processes need to be taken into account. Yet, the data suggest that the regulatory pathways leading to DT act redundantly and respond to both developmental and environmental cues. None of the monogenic mutation in the 49 TF gene that were identified in the desiccome induced lethal or desiccation sensitive phenotypes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, except for ABI3. These TFs are likely acting redundantly depending of the environmental context. Our data suggest that ABI3 and ABI5 have complementary roles in DT and act in a complex combinatorial control of gene expression (Nakamura et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Finkelstein et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Cutler et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Lindemose et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The desiccome contained a surprisingly high number of transcripts for which <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologs are involved in the control of flowering, cellular phase transitions and cell identity. These data suggest that DT evolved by coopting existing genetic pathways regulating developmental phase transition and light-sensing. There is increasing evidence in the literature suggesting an interaction between photoperiod and drought stress, whereby photoperiodically- or light-induced genes coordinate the ABA-mediated activation of genes (Chen et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Riboni et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, it is important to investigate whether genes regulated by photoperiod or light have a conserved function regulating DT both in seeds as well as resurrection plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors contributions</title><p>Julia Buitink and Olivier Leprince conceived and designed the experiments and wrote the MS.
