However, while the flowers within the Brassicaceae members are rather uniform, mainly radially symmetrical, mostly white with fixed organ numbers, species within the Cleomaceae, the sister family to the Brassicaceae show a more variable floral morphology.

The species belongs to the section Tarenaya and the subgenus Neocleome within the Cleomaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] which includes roughly 300 species distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The family Cleomaceae belongs to the order Brassicales and previously Cleomaceae were thought to be more closely related to Capparaeceae but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that Cleomaceae are more closely related to and a sister family to Brassicaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Molecular clock analyses suggests that Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae diverged from each other around 24.2 &#x02013; 49.4 Million Years Ago (MYA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of normalized expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences in <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and comparative genome analysis in <italic>Carica papaya</italic>, both members of the Brassicales, and in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> belonging to Brassicaceae revealed that Cleomaceae share the most ancient gamma (&#x003b3;) whole genome duplication (WGD) with both <italic>C. papaya</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The sister families Brassicaceae and Cleomaceae also share the more recent beta (&#x003b2;) WGD which is lacking in <italic>C. papaya</italic>. However, the third and most recent alpha (&#x003b1;) WGD has occurred independently in Brassicaceae and Cleomaceae. The <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> &#x003b1; WGD (Th- &#x003b1;) is a genome triplication and occurred approximately 13.7 MYA, while the <italic>Arabidopsis thalian</italic>a &#x003b1; WGD (At- &#x003b1;) happened around 23.3 MYA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In spite of the recent Th- &#x003b1; triplication event the genome of <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> is only 1.9 times the size of that of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and around half the size of the <italic>C. papaya</italic> genome. The small genome size of <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> indicates rapid diploidization, and a faster subsequent gene loss when compared to <italic>A. thaliana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Cleomaceae are being intensively studied as C4 type photosynthesis evolved de novo in this group of plants. While <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and other Brassicaceae are C3 plants, C4 photosynthesis evolved in Cleomaceae at least three times independently in <italic>Gynandropsis gynandra</italic>, <italic>Cleome oxalidea</italic>, and <italic>Cleome angustifolia. Cleome paradoxa</italic> shows a C3 &#x02013; C4 intermediate anatomy and physiology thus making Cleomaceae a model system to study C3 &#x02013; C4 evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Comparative leaf transcriptome studies by RNA-Seq have been carried out in <italic>G. gynandra</italic> (C4) and <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> (C3) to elucidate and identify novel genes and gene networks responsible for the C4 anatomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>T. hassleriana</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is also called the spider flower plant due to the long stamens which appear like appendages of spiders and is a popular ornamental plant owing to its colorful and abundant flowers. Adult plants can grow about five feet tall and several feet in diameter with several lateral branches. The stem and the lateral branches are soft and succulent but the main stem and older branches become woody with age. The leaves are palmate with 3&#x02013;5 folioles per leaf (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a). Plants start flowering while they are in the juvenile stages and most of vegetative growth overlaps with the flowering period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Tarenaya hassleriana </italic></bold><bold>plant. a)</bold> Morphology of a flowering <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> plant. <bold>b)</bold> Flower at anthesis showing four small purple sepals, four showy pink petals, six yellow stamens and a central gynoecium. <bold>c)</bold> Bud stages 1&#x02013;6 characterized by bud length, bud stage 1 (&#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;mm), bud stage 2 (3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mm), bud stage 3 (4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mm), bud stage 4 (6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;mm), bud stage 5 (8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mm), bud stage 6 (12&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mm).

Each flower has four sepals, four petals, six stamens, and a single gynoecium composed of two fused carpels (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b). The flower buds are laid out in a disymmetric bauplan during the early developmental stages which changes near anthesis and the mature flowers become zygomorphic. Conversely, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> early developmental bud stages are monosymmetric and the flowers become disymmetric near anthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>C. papaya</italic> flowers on the other hand are actinomorphic at anthesis but early development has not been characterized yet. <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> inflorescences produce hermaphroditic, female, or male only flowers such that fruits are only periodically formed. The synchronous and alternate appearance of male, female, and hermaphroditic flowers in a raceme favors out-crossing, and prevents selfing except in the case of the hermaphroditic flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This feature distinguishes <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> from most plants which are either dioecious (like <italic>C. papaya</italic>) with separate male and female plants which rarely produce hermaphroditic flowers, or monoecious like <italic>A. thaliana</italic> which is an obligate self-pollinated plant with hermaphroditic flowers. <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> plants are very prolific, they reseed and establish in suitable environments very easily and escape from cultivation, often becoming invasive in subtropical countries like Japan, New Zealand, parts of Australia, and the United States of America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hence many horticultural varieties, possibly like the one used in this study were developed to be sterile so that they cannot establish in non-native environments.</p><p>Also unlike most Brassicales <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> flowers are very colorful due to the presence of various anthocyanins and show &#x02018;petal fading&#x02019; i.e. loss of pigmentation and dry matter associated with anthesis. This phenomenon coupled with favored cross pollination may suggest a specific role in flower - pollinator interactions or simply an age related phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>A close relationship to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> facilitates the analysis of <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> specific traits, such as flower coloration, alternating development of three types of flowers and flexible shifts from vegetative to reproductive growth, which are all not found in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Here, we describe the floral transcriptome sequence along with Transcriptome Sequencing Expression (TSE) of a horticultural <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> hybrid as a starting point for further analysis of Tarenaya flower development. Expression analysis by qRT-PCR documents the robustness of the TSE and rarefaction analysis shows that the transcriptome sequencing covers even rare transcripts.

Of special interest were genes annotated to be involved in anthocyanin accumulation, cell growth, flower development and other developmental processes. Candidate genes were selected for further analysis (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). High expression of <italic>PGP10</italic> homolog, a gene involved in anthocyanin accumulation in response to UV light was observed in the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> floral transcriptome whereas its expression is limited to pollen in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The homolog of <italic>TTFP</italic> which codes for a tyrosine transaminase family protein was also expressed at high levels in the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> floral transcriptome; this gene is involved in regulation of cell growth in response to external stimulus and is primarily expressed in the roots of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Other notable gene homologs involved in various aspects of cell growth were <italic>LRX2, HAT4</italic> and <italic>PIP5K3</italic>. Of the gene homologs involved in various aspects of floral development, prominent were <italic>ICMTA</italic> and <italic>TEM2. ICMTA</italic> is an enzyme belonging to the methyltransferase family, which is inducted during floral morphogenesis. <italic>TEM2</italic> is a transcription factor known for its role in flowering time regulation by controlling <italic>FT</italic> expression. Amongst the genes annotated as genes governing various aspects of development were <italic>JAL33, MTSP1</italic>, <italic>EMB2217</italic> and <italic>GLUDOXRP</italic> which are involved in embryo and root development.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p><bold>Selection of homologous gene pairs in which the homologs of </bold><bold>

related rosids and genes that are specific to the Cleome lineage a BLASTX search with a cut off value of e<sup>-10</sup> was performed with the 49,237 Tarenaya floral transcriptome contigs against the <italic>A. thaliana, Brassica rapa, C. papaya</italic> (all malvids, order Brassicales) and <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> (fabid, order Malpighiales) protein databases in a systematic manner (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>a). This allows the assessment of gene births and gene losses in the rosid lineage. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>b shows the result of the comparative analysis: A large number of the contigs 37,989 (subset I) represent the sequences shared between malvids and fabids. According to our analysis, only 684 genes are shared between all Brassicales, but 1375 genes (subset B) are shared between the core Brassicales, which include <italic>T. hassleriana, A. thaliana,</italic> and <italic>B. rapa</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This suggests a high rate of gene births in the lineage leading to core Brassicales after their split from the lineage leading to <italic>C. papaya</italic>. Conversely, 148 genes (subset K) are shared between <italic>T. hassleriana, C. papaya</italic> and <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> and not found in the Brassicaceae suggesting that these genes were lost in the lineage leading to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>B. rapa</italic> after its separation from the lineage leading to <italic>T. hassleriana</italic>. Another 132 (subset G) genes are found only in <italic>C. papaya</italic> and <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> indicating that these are Brassicales-specific genes that were lost in the Brassicaceae. 453 genes are shared between <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> but not found in <italic>B. rapa</italic> suggesting that they were lost in the lineage leading to <italic>B. rapa</italic>.

Of these contigs only 82 could be assigned to 353 GO terms, but a vast majority of the contigs could not be annotated attributing to no significant BLAST hits. A sequence length histogram for these contigs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2) shows a bias towards shorter sequences when compared to the sequence length histogram of all contigs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S1b) suggesting that these were too short for proper annotation and/or may represent 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; UTR regions of transcripts. Another reason for the small number of annotated genes is because most of the current annotations are based on <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic> and we already subtracted the sequences orthologous to them. The GO annotations for the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> specific genes are the following: cellular process (26.98%), metabolic process (29.36%), response to stimulus (4.76%), biological regulation (4.7%), development (1.5%), cell proliferation (1.5%), reproduction (6.34%) and signaling processes (4.76%) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S6).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work we present the floral transcriptome sequence of <italic>T. hassleriana</italic>, which is a member of the Cleomaceae and thus a sister taxon to the Brassicaceae. The transcriptome was analyzed by rarefaction analysis and shown to be of sufficient depth to also identify rare transcripts. As normalization was not carried out, abundance of transcripts could be assessed in silico and compared to qRT-PCR data. The leaf transcriptome of <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> has been published earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] allowing for comparison of transcript abundance between the leaf and the floral transcriptome. We also attempted to compare the expression of genes represented in the floral transcriptome with the expression of their respective <italic>A. thaliana</italic> orthologs based on presence/absence of expression in the microarray dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] including all flower developmental stages. In addition, we are able to identify 5600 putative transcripts that are specific to the Cleomaceae and 684, which are shared only among the Brassicales <italic>C. papaya</italic>, <italic>T. hassleriana, B. rapa</italic>, and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p><p>During assembly, annotation and analysis of the reads obtained by 454 sequencing we observed several challenges. In our study we correlated the in silico floral transcriptome expression in <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> with the conventional qRT-PCR expression of arbitrarily chosen genes with low, moderate, and high expression levels for validation of the transcriptome sequencing expression data. For the in silico expression data we applied two approaches, one was to map the individual reads to the annotated A. thaliana CDS sequences (TSE1), with the advantage that expression data for putative <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> orthologs of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes can be generated without a prior genome sequence information of <italic>T. hassleriana</italic>, thus individual reads are not assembled into contigs. The second approach was the de novo assembly of the reads into contigs that are then annotated and the reads are mapped on to these contigs (TSE2). Comparing both methods with qRT-PCR data, the TSE1 approach clearly matches better than the TSE2 approach. One reason for this finding is the presence of chimeric contigs composed of more than one gene, in such cases reads to multiple genes are mapped onto the same contig flaring up the expression. This problem is avoided in TSE1 when the reads are mapped onto orthologous sequences in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Another reason for the disparity between the qRT-PCR expression and TSE2 is due to assembly of contigs with additional non coding nucleotide sequences. This phenomenon was observed in the case of <italic>RBCS1A</italic> amongst the genes analyzed. The assembled contig was 838 nucleotides long whereas the coding sequence of this gene is ~540 nucleotides across many plant lineages. The additional 295 nucleotides at the 3&#x02019; end could represent the 3&#x02019; UTR nonetheless reads would be mapped to such sequences leading to an overestimation of expression. The third reason for the differences in the expression between qRT-PCR and TSE2 may be the length of the assembled contig versus transcript size, as larger transcripts are fragmented prior cDNA library preparation. For TSE1, qRT-PCR expression data were normalized to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> CDS lengths and in case of TSE2 to <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> contig length. The necessity of normalization was seen in case of gene <italic>SPL7</italic>. The <italic>SPL7</italic> contig length was 629 nucleotides whereas the coding sequence of <italic>SPL7</italic> in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is 2406 nucleotides, thus when the expression is normalized for length of the contig it leads to a much higher expression than when normalized to the length of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ortholog. In case where the contig length matched to the coding sequence length and when the contig had very low or almost no unknown sequences incorporated the qRT-PCR expression matched very well to the TSE2 as was observed in case of <italic>TT4</italic>.</p><p>However, since <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> have, independent &#x003b1;-WGDs, the retention and loss of gene copies following the duplication will be different. By mapping the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> reads onto the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> orthologs identical sets of orthologous gene copies are assumed for both species leading to over or underestimation of transcript abundance. These illustrated pitfalls for calculating gene expression from RNAseq experiments without the availability of a high-quality reference transcriptome or genome require thorough independent validation of gene expression data.</p><p>This work was initiated as a primer to identify genes that may contribute to the morphological differences between the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> and the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> flower. Our focus was mainly on coloration, flowering time, and floral organ size as these are traits that show obvious differences between the two species.</p><p><italic>T. hassleriana</italic> petals show a deep pink coloration which, when the flower opens, fades into light pink after a few days of exposure to the sun. While in most species only the epidermal petal cell layer is pigmented, <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> also has pigmented mesophyll cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; suggesting an expansion of the anthocyanin regulation and biosynthesis pathway from petal to mesophyll cells. The pink pigments found in <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> flowers are acetylated cyanidin diglucoside (sophorosyl)-5-glucosides and acetylated pelargonidin sophorosyl-5-glucosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. All genes required for the synthesis of pelargonidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside are present in the flower transcriptome. Genes encoding proteins required for the early steps of anthocyanin up to the flavonoid myricetin are also found expressed in the leaf transcriptome, while the genes participating in later steps such as <italic>DFR</italic> and <italic>LDOX</italic> are restricted to the flower. These two enzymes are also not expressed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> flowers but during seed development and late stages of leaf senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Transcription factors of the MYB, bHLH, and WD40 families regulate the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and Zea mays. While early biosynthesis genes, and their regulators such as <italic>AtMYB11</italic>, <italic>AtMYB12</italic>, and <italic>AtMYB111</italic> are involved in the production of flavonols, late biosynthesis genes and their regulators are required for the synthesis of anthocyanins from flavonols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and references therein. While the putative T. hassleriana orthologs of <italic>AtMYB11</italic> and <italic>AtMYB12</italic> are hardly expressed in the flower transcriptome, the putative <italic>AtMYB111</italic> ortholog shows very strong and flower specific expression suggesting a more prominent role for this gene in the regulation of early biosynthesis genes than for the putative orthologs of <italic>AtMYB11</italic> and <italic>AtMYB12</italic>. Orthologs of the regulators of late anthocyanin biosynthesis in <italic>A. thaliana AtTTG1</italic> (WD40 family member), <italic>AtTT8, AtGL3, AtEGL3</italic> (all bHLH family members) and <italic>AtPAP2</italic> (MYB family member) are also found expressed in the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> flowers. The <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> orthologs of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genes <italic>AtTTG1, AtTT8, AtGL3, AtEGL3</italic>, and <italic>AtPAP2</italic> forming the late anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory complex show an approximately similar transcript abundance suggesting that they may function in a complex similar to the one in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, only with an expression domain expanded to the floral organs.</p><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> late regulators are mainly expressed in senescing leaves and during seed development (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), but most likely, their expression domain in <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> has expanded into the flower leading to the pink coloration of the floral organs. A similar situation is found in petunia, where, among others genes <italic>AN1, AN11, AN2</italic> and <italic>AN4</italic> form complexes similar to that in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in the flower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p><italic>T. hassleriana</italic> has, unlike <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, large oval shaped petals, and indeed orthologs of genes involved in limiting growth of floral organs were found to be hardly expressed in the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> floral transcriptome. <italic>BIG BROTHER</italic>, encoding for a E3 ubiquitin-ligase represses cell proliferation in all <italic>A. thaliana</italic> proliferating tissues and is expressed strongly and uniformly in all developmental stages of the flower independently of other pathways while being a direct target of the petal organ identity gene <italic>AP3</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> floral transcriptome it has a very low expression of 9 RPKM, suggesting that this may be a reasonable candidate to account for the differences in petal size between the two species.</p><p>The particular <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> hybrid used in this study is sterile even though it produces all the floral organ whorls in the right number and position. However, even though the anthers developed, they did not produce any pollen and also did not dehisce rendering the plants male sterile. While orthologs of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> regulators of anther development were expressed in the the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> flower, no expression of <italic>ROXY1</italic> and <italic>ROXY2</italic> was detected. These two genes redundantly control the anther lobe and pollen mother cell differentiation downstream of <italic>SPL</italic> in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover, only very low expression (6 RPKM) was observed for the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> ortholog of <italic>DYT1</italic> which acts directly downstream of the <italic>ROXY</italic> genes. The phenotype of the <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> anthers also resembles the <italic>roxy1 roxy2</italic> double mutant anther phenotype in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, suggesting that our <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> hybrid may lack functional <italic>ROXY</italic> genes leading to male sterility. We corroborated this observation by qRT-PCR expression data which not only detected very low <italic>ROXY1</italic> expression (the only <italic>ROXY</italic> ortholog in <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]) in the mid developmental stage but also showed the de-regulation of expression of the upstream and downstream genes throughout bud development which may provide a cause for the male sterility.</p><p><italic>T. hassleriana</italic> is perpetually flowering and a sharp transition to flowering as in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> cannot be observed. Several genes involved in flowering time regulation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are differently regulated in leaves and flowers and we compared the expression of their orthologs in the flower and leaf transcriptomes. FRI is a protein involved in activating transcription via chromatin remodeling of the central floral repressor <italic>FLC</italic> in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and is expressed rather uniformly throughout the plant. However, in <italic>T. hassleriana</italic>, <italic>FRI</italic> ortholog expression is not found in leaves. This may suggest a different mechanism for <italic>FLC</italic> ortholog activation in <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> leaves, as <italic>FLC</italic> is expressed there without the presence of <italic>FRI</italic>.</p><p>Interestingly; the expression of two more genes most likely involved in the change from vegetative to reproductive phase in <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> is different from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene <italic>SMZ</italic> is expressed in young seedlings, during floral transition and seed maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] unlike its <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> ortholog which is expressed in flowers and developing buds. Possibly, the <italic>T. hassleriana SMZ</italic> has function different from its <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ortholog, which is a rather strong repressor of flowering.</p><p>Another candidate gene in the group of flowering time regulators that are differentially regulated in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>T. hassleriana</italic> is <italic>ATC</italic>. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>ATC</italic> is strongly expressed in the root and a small fraction (1-5%) of its mRNAs moves a long distance to the plant&#x02019;s apex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Notably, we find a significant amount of reads in flower tissue, too many to attribute them to long distance RNA transport.
