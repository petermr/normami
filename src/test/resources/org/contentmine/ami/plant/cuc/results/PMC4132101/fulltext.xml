<italic>Citrullus colocynthis</italic> is a very drought tolerant species, closely related to watermelon (<italic>C. lanatus</italic> var. <italic>lanatus</italic>), an economically important cucurbit crop. Drought is a threat to plant growth and development, and the discovery of drought inducible genes with various functions is of great importance. We used high throughput mRNA Illumina sequencing technology and bioinformatic strategies to analyze the <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> leaf transcriptome under drought treatment. Leaf samples at four different time points (0, 24, 36, or 48 hours of withholding water) were used for RNA extraction and Illumina sequencing. qRT-PCR of several drought responsive genes was performed to confirm the accuracy of RNA sequencing. Leaf transcriptome analysis provided the first glimpse of the drought responsive transcriptome of this unique cucurbit species. A total of 5038 full-length cDNAs were detected, with 2545 genes showing significant changes during drought stress. Principle component analysis indicated that drought was the major contributing factor regulating transcriptome changes. Up regulation of many transcription factors, stress signaling factors, detoxification genes, and genes involved in phytohormone signaling and citrulline metabolism occurred under the water deficit conditions. The <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> transcriptome data highlight the activation of a large set of drought related genes in this species, thus providing a valuable resource for future functional analysis of candidate genes in defense of drought stress.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding or sources of support for the study were the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station and the State of Alabama.

Drought delays the development of crops, and strongly affects morphology, as well as physiological processes like transpiration, photosynthesis, respiration and translocation of assimilates <xref rid="pone.0104657-Do1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Drought avoidance can be achieved through morphological changes in plants, such as decreased stomatal conductance, reduced leaf area, and extensive root systems <xref rid="pone.0104657-Levitt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Drought tolerance is achieved by physiological and molecular mechanisms, including osmotic adjustment, antioxidant and scavenger compounds <xref rid="pone.0104657-Bartels1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Both strategies involve the induction of specific genes and proteins, such as dehydrins (dehydration-induced proteins), key enzymes for osmolyte biosynthesis, and detoxification enzymes <xref rid="pone.0104657-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104657-YamaguchiShinozaki1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Plant species have developed diverse strategies to adapt and thrive in all kinds of climates and terrains to deal with extreme changes in the environment. These strategies are supported by rich and complex metabolic networks that enable the plant to synthesize a wide range of compounds. Plant responses to abiotic stresses involve interactions and crosstalk between many molecular pathways. High throughput screening techniques such as transcriptome sequencing have been used to study the adaptability of plants to drought <xref rid="pone.0104657-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This led to the discovery of many drought related genes. For example, PIP aquaporins were found to fine-tune the environment in response to declining water availability <xref rid="pone.0104657-Srbanovski1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, few natural allelic variants have been cloned for drought related traits, so QTL, RNA sequencing, and other trait isolation methods are needed to improve methodology for exploring complex multivariate data <xref rid="pone.0104657-Caccamo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104657-Juenger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The cucurbit family is a large family with several economically important species, such as watermelon (<italic>Citrullus lanatus</italic>), melon (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic>), cucumber (<italic>Cucumis sativus</italic>) and several <italic>Cucurbita</italic> species with edible fruits <xref rid="pone.0104657-Jeffrey1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. <italic>Citrullus colocynthis</italic> (L.) Schrad (2n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2x&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22), the bitter apple, closely related to domesticated watermelon (<italic>Citrullus lanatus</italic> var. <italic>lanatus</italic>), is a very drought-tolerant perennial herbaceous species in the Cucurbitaceae family <xref rid="pone.0104657-Dane1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It can survive arid environments by maintaining its water content under severe stress conditions. <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> is an important medicinal plant and a source of valuable oil <xref rid="pone.0104657-Dane1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Its seeds were found in several early Egyptian, Libyan and Near Eastern sites from about 4000 BC.

The species has been used as a model to elucidate the function of genes implicated in the stress response ultimately leading to enhancement of stress tolerance in cucurbit crops through genetic manipulation. Si et al. <xref rid="pone.0104657-Si1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> found dynamic gene expression changes in <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> root tissues using cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) technique.</p><p>Several research groups have used next generation sequencing technologies to study gene expression profiles in species of the cucurbit family. Guo et al <xref rid="pone.0104657-Guo2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> used 454 sequencing technology to study the comprehensive profile for watermelon fruit flesh tissues, Grassi et al <xref rid="pone.0104657-Grassi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> studied carotenoid pathway regulators in ripening watermelon fruit. The draft genome of watermelon (<italic>C. lanatus</italic>, 2n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2x&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22, &#x0223c;425 Mb) was analyzed by Guo et al <xref rid="pone.0104657-Guo3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> using three different watermelon subspecies. Comparative genomic analysis provided an evolutionary scenario for the origin of the 11 watermelon chromosomes derived from a 7-chromosome paleohexaploid eudicot ancestor. The genome sequence of cucumber (<italic>Cucumis sativus</italic>, 2n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2x&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14) has been completed, and the genome of melon (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic>, 2n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2x&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24) is being sequenced under the Spanish Genomics Initiative (MELONOMICS) <xref rid="pone.0104657-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104657-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

<italic>C. colocynthis</italic> seedlings were grown in Sunshine Mix #8 under a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod at 26&#x000b0;C day, 22&#x000b0;C night temperature. Seedlings with 2&#x02013;3 true leaves (2&#x02013;3 week old) in 50 ml containers were exposed to drought by withholding water for 0 (day 1, D1), 24 (day 2, D2), 36 (day 3, D3) or 48 hours (day 4, D4). True leaf samples were collected each day at noon, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Enrichment of cDNA templates was conducted following fifteen cycles of PCR amplification. In total, over 20*4Mp were sequenced for mapping assembly and differential expression analysis.
