However, molecular resources for most monoecious non-model species are limited, hampering our ability to study the molecular mechanisms involved in flower development of these species. The objective of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes during the development of male and female flowers of the monoecious species <italic>Quercus suber</italic>, an economically important Mediterranean tree. Total RNA was extracted from different developmental stages of <italic>Q. suber</italic> flowers. Non-normalized cDNA libraries of male and female flowers were generated using 454 pyrosequencing technology producing a total of 962,172 high-quality reads with an average length of 264 nucleotides. The assembly of the reads resulted in 14,488 contigs for female libraries and 10,438 contigs for male libraries. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes revealed genes differentially expressed in early and late stages of development of female and male flowers, some of which have been shown to be involved in pollen development, in ovule formation and in flower development of other species with a monoecious, dioecious, or hermaphroditic sexual system. Moreover, we found differentially expressed genes that have not yet been characterized and others that have not been previously shown to be implicated in flower development. This transcriptomic analysis constitutes a major step toward the characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in flower development in a monoecious tree with a potential contribution toward the knowledge of conserved developmental mechanisms in other species.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>flower development</kwd><kwd>monoecious</kwd><kwd>pyrosequencing</kwd><kwd><italic>Quercus suber</italic></kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>cork oak</kwd><kwd>EST</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="125"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="11861"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Quercus suber</italic> (L.) is one of the most important forest species in Portugal, being the dominant tree of the oak woodlands (Aronson et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Due to its ecological and socio-economic significance, the cork oak forest is a unique resource. There is a growing interest in the management of woods for the production of acorns destined either for nursery production or for animal feed stocks. Therefore, the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that control flower induction and fertilization is crucial to fully understand the reproductive success of this species.</p><p><italic>Quercus suber</italic> is a monoecious tree species with a protandrous system and a long progamic phase (period between pollination and fertilization). Male flowers are organized in catkins that emerge in reproductive buds of the previous growth season or at the base of the branches of the current season. Each individual catkin contain 15&#x02013;25 staminate flowers that are radially set around the catkin's axis (Natividade, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1950</xref>). The staminate flowers present a perianth with four to six tepals with an equal or double number of anthers that do not burst simultaneously (Boavida et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Female inflorescences arise in spikes, with three to five flowers, on the axil of the new leaves. Female flowers are included in a cupule and contain three carpels, with two ovules each (Boavida et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Male flowering buds occur in early spring and sometimes also in autumn, whereas female flowers appear in spring and only get fully developed a few months later, if pollinated. During spike elongation, three to five styles emerge from the cupule and the stigma becomes receptive (Ducousso et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). At the time of pollination the ovary is still undifferentiated and the transmitting tissue extends only to the base of the styles. The wind driven pollen lays on the receptive stigmatic surface, germinates and the pollen tube grows throughout the transmitting tissue, until it reaches the base of the style. Usually, the pollen tube growth is arrested for 6 weeks, overlapping with ovule differentiation (Boavida et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Kanazashi and Kanazashi, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). After fertilization, only one of the six ovules develops into a monospermic seed, which matures during autumn (Ducousso et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Boavida et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><p>Flower development is a complex and dynamic process that requires the tight coordination of gene expression and environmental cues (Fornara et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). During the past several years, a significant progress has been made in elucidating the genetic networks involved in flower organ specification in hermaphroditic model (reviewed in Wellmer et al., <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and non-model species (Wu et al., <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Yoo et al., <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Zahn et al., <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Logacheva et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Varkonyi-Gasic et al., <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Unisexual flower specification requires developmentally regulated processes that initiate male and female organ primordia in separate parts of the plant (Dellaporta and Calderon-Urrea, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Studies focusing on mutant isolation revealed that several genes affect the key steps of sex determination in a variety of species. For example, in maize, unisexuality is controlled by <italic>TASSELSEED2</italic> that is expressed in the male structure (tassel) and is involved in pistil primordia abortion (DeLong et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Also, in melon, a single nucleotide change in the <italic>1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLIC ACID SYNTHASE</italic> gene is responsible for the specific inhibition of the male reproductive organs (Boualem et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, the previous limitation of mutant isolation in important model and non-model species was surpassed (Rowan et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In another Cucurbitaceae, prior knowledge established a link between the de-regulation of the homeotic ABC model genes and sex determinacy (Kater et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Using NGS technology, Guo et al. (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) further helped to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying sex determinacy in cucumber by comparing the transcriptomes of the two types of flowers (gynoecious and hermaphroditic). In <italic>Quercus</italic> spp., many studies have been conducted focusing on the morphology of reproductive organs (Kaul, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), life cycle (Ducousso et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Elena-Rossello et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), flowering process (Varela and Valdiviesso, <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), and embryogenesis (Stairs, <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">1964</xref>). However, molecular information regarding these mechanisms is still scarce. Ueno et al. (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) described the first large-scale study of bud transcriptomes of the two main European white oak species (<italic>Q. petraea</italic> and <italic>Q. robur</italic>). Ueno et al. (<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) used the same pyrosequencing technology to characterize the bud transcriptomes of endo- and ecodormant sessile oak (<italic>Q. petraea</italic>). Recently, the transcriptome of <italic>Q. suber</italic> has been reported using 21 normalized cDNA libraries derived from multiple <italic>Q. suber</italic> tissues and organs, developmental stages and physiological conditions (Pereira-Leal et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This work included two normalized libraries of <italic>Q. suber</italic> (male and female) flowers that could serve as a tool to mine genes in each flower type. However, data concerning differentially expressed genes during different developmental stages of each type of flower were still missing.</p><p>In the present work, with the aim of capturing the diversity of transcripts differentially expressed in male and female <italic>Q. suber</italic> flowers, inflorescences in different developmental stages were separately collected and non-normalized cDNA libraries were generated and sequenced using the 454 GS-FLX Titanium technology. This study provides a unique set of databases, invaluable for gene discovery, which might reveal the regulatory networks of sex-specific flower development of a non-model monoecious tree species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>Six developmental stages of male and female cork oak flowers were collected from different trees in three different locations in Portugal (Lisbon, Porto, and Braga).

The same amount of RNA was combined to create four specific RNA pools, two for female flowers (1F and 2F) and two for male flowers (1M and 2M), covering either early (1F or 1M) or late (2F or 2M) developmental stages. Pool 1F (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) contained RNA from female buds enclosed by protective scales (Cf), female reddish buds with open scales (Df) and buds showing the elongation of the spike axe and the emergency of the first pair of flowers (Ef). The 2F pool (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) included RNA from female flowers showing distinct, erect, yellow stigmas with curved pinkish/brownish tips (Ff), flowers with shining yellow and viscous pattern stigmas in clear divergent position (Ff2) and flowers with closed stigmas that lost the receptivity, exhibiting a dark brown color (Gf). The 1M pool (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) comprised RNA from catkins with red round shape (Cm), elongated clustered male flowers (Dm), and pendent catkins with some individualized flowers (Dm2). The 2M pool (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) included male flowers in which the anthers were becoming individualized (Em), flowers with individualized green/yellow anthers, prior to pollen shedding (Fm) and catkins with male flowers in full anthesis (pollen shedding occurring in half of the flowers with some anthers eventually empty) (Gm). RNA integrity was verified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the RNA 6000 Pico kit (Agilent Technologies) and the quantity assessed by fluorometry with the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA kit (Invitrogen). A fraction of 2.0 &#x003bc; g of each pool of total RNA was used as starting material for cDNA synthesis using the MINT cDNA synthesis kit (Evrogen), where a strategy based on SMART double-stranded cDNA synthesis (Zhu et al., <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) was applied. During the amplification of the poly RNA molecules, a known adapter sequence was introduced to both ends of the first strand of cDNA. The synthesis was also performed using a modified oligo-dT, containing a restriction site for <italic>Bsg</italic>I that is needed to eliminate the tails, to minimize the interference of homopolymers during the 454-sequencing run. cDNA was quantified by fluorescence and sequenced in a full plate of 454 GS FLX Titanium system, according to the standard manufacturer's instructions (Roche-454 Life Sciences) at Biocant (Cantanhede, Portugal). Sequence reads were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the accession number SRP044882.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence processing assembly and annotation</title><p>Prior to the assembly of sequences, the raw reads were processed in order to remove sequences with less than 100 nucleotides and low-quality regions. The ribosomal, mitochondrial and chloroplast reads were also identified and removed from the data set. The reads were then assembled into contigs using 454 Newbler 2.6 (Roche) with the default parameters (40 bp overlap and 90% identity).</p><p>The translation frame of contigs was assessed through BLASTx searches against Swissprot (<italic>e</italic>-value = 1e&#x02013;6), and the corresponding amino acid sequences translated using an in-house script. Next, the contigs without translation were submitted to FrameDP software (Gouzy et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and the remaining contigs were analyzed with ESTScan (Lottaz et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Transcripts resulting from these two last sequence identification steps (FrameDP and ESTScan) were searched using BLASTp against the non-redundant NBCI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database in order to translate the putative proteins.</p><p>The deduced aminoacid sequences were annotated using InterProScan (Hunter et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and each was given the Gene ontology terms (GOs) (Ashburner et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>To identify the differential gene expression between samples, the contigs were clustered using the CD-Hit 454 (Niu et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) application (90% similarity) in order to eliminate redundant sequences and generate reference contigs. After this step, the contigs that codify non-redundant proteins were used as reference to map the reads. The mapping process was made using 454 Newbler Mapping 2.6 (Roche). The mapping results were quantified to obtain the number of reads from different samples and a contingency table with contig names was created using the number of reads per reference contig per sample. The contingency table was normalized at a 95 percentile using the MyRNA (Langmead et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) statistical analysis package and the differential gene expression was evaluated using a linear regression model based on a Gaussian distribution and taking into account only contigs with a minimum of eight mapped reads and FDR &#x0003c; 0.05. Differentially expressed were clustered using the Self-organizing Trees algorithm (SOTA), euclidean distance (Dopazo and Carazo, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Herrero et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and the default settings of the MeV: MultiExperiment Viewer program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tm4.org/mev.html">http://www.tm4.org/mev.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>qRT-PCR analysis</title><p>cDNA was synthesized from the same RNA samples used for the 454 sequencing, according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified using SsoFast&#x02122; EvaGreen&#x000ae; Supermix (Bio-Rad), 250 nM of each gene-specific primer (listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S1</xref>) and 1 &#x003bc; L of cDNA (1:100 dilution). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions were performed in triplicates on the CFX96 Touch&#x02122; Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). After an initial period of 3 min at 95&#x000b0;C, each of the 40 PCR cycles consisted of a denaturation step of 10 s at 95&#x000b0;C and an annealing/extension step of 10 s at the gene specific primer temperature. With each PCR reaction, a melting curve was obtained to check for amplification specificity and reaction contaminations, by heating the amplification products from 60&#x000b0;C to 95&#x000b0;C in 5 s intervals. Primer efficiency was analyzed with CFX Manager&#x02122; Software v3.1 (Bio-Rad), using the Livak calculation method for normalized expression (Livak and Schmittgen, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).

The analysis showed that there were 230 unique contigs for the early (1F) and 214 contigs unique for the late (2F) stages of female flower development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The 1F unique contigs might correspond to genes controlling early flower development, whereas the 2F unique contigs might be associated with stigma maturation, ovule development and fertilization. Accordingly, there were 198 contigs unique in the early stages of male flower development (1M), most probably involved in early stages of anther development and 327 contigs specific for the late stages (2M) that could be indicative of genes controlling pollen development and maturation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). A normalization cut-off of eight reads at the 95th percentile was applied, resulting in 3760 differentially expressed genes (19.9%) for the 1F_2F_1M_2M transcriptome. Differentially expressed genes were then clustered into different groups according to their expression profile similarity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Another member of this family is <italic>SlKLUH</italic>, which controls not only plant architecture but also fruit mass and ripening in tomato (Chakrabarti et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We also identified a homolog for <italic>1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE OXIDASE 66</italic>, that belongs to a family of genes that has been associated to ethylene biosynthesis (Barry and Giovannoni, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Several <italic>RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASES</italic> (<italic>RLPK</italic>) have been linked to key aspects of plant development: the brassinosteroids signaling pathway (Schumacher and Chory, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), meristem maintenance (Clark, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), or pollen-pistil interaction (McCubbin and Kao, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Thus, a 65 times more expressed <italic>QsRLPK</italic> transcript in female flowers might have an important role in carpel development.</p><p>Within the group of genes with the highest differential expression in male flowers, there were three unknown genes without a significant BLAST hit. These three genes may be specific to <italic>Q. suber</italic> and pivotal to anther differentiation and development in this species. Two highly represented <italic>QsCHALCONE SYNTHASE A</italic> genes were identified as male unique transcripts. A suppressor mutant of the <italic>CHALCONE SYNTHASE A</italic> homolog gene in <italic>Petunia</italic> generates viable pollen, however, pollen germination and tube growth are severely affected (Taylor and Jorgensen, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), which indicates that this gene is essential for proper anther development. <italic>CHALCONE SYNTHASE A</italic> associated genes are also known to be involved in the metabolic pathway that leads to the production of flavonoids and anthocyanin pigments in several species (Winkel-Shirley, <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the coloration on the anthers might be due to the action of the highly expressed <italic>QsCHALCONE SYNTHASE A</italic> genes. A <italic>Qs4-COURAMATE&#x02013;CoA LIGASE-LIKE 1</italic> gene that is related to the <italic>ACOS</italic> genes was also identified. These genes have been associated with proper pollen development (De Azevedo Souza et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The <italic>DEFECTIVE IN ANTHER DEHISCENCE1</italic> (<italic>DAD1</italic>) is a lipase-like gene involved in pollen development (Ishiguro et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In <italic>A. thaliana dad1</italic> shows defects in anther dehiscence, pollen maturation, and flower opening (Ishiguro et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). <italic>QsLIPASE-LIKE</italic> might also have a similar function.</p><p>To investigate whether these genes were flower specific, available root, leaf, bud and fruit libraries (Pereira-Leal et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) were used. Interestingly, all the male-associated genes are exclusive to the male flower except for <italic>QsLIPASE-like</italic>, which is expressed in almost all the other tissues with the exception of the female flower and leaves (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The majority of the female-associated genes analyzed are not flower specific. Interestingly, there is one gene that is present only in the buds, flowers and fruits (<italic>QsNON-SPECIFIC LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEIN</italic>), suggesting a putative role in the female reproductive determinism. At least two genes are expressed in all the organs (<italic>QsPOLYGALACTURONASE-1</italic> and <italic>QsRECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE</italic>) except for the male flowers. Considering that these genes are expressed in all <italic>Q. suber</italic> tissues analyzed and absent from the male flowers might be indicative that these flowers go through a very distinctive developmental programme, or that the mentioned genes expression could be detrimental to proper male flower development. It will be very interesting to perform functional studies to analyse the involvement of the aforementioned genes in plant reproduction or flower development in <italic>Q. suber</italic> and other flowering species.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factors differentially expressed in female and male flowers</title><p>Differential expression of transcription factors (TF) has a pivotal role in the control of mechanisms that direct organ development (Latchman, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).

Among these, the C2H2-type and B-box zinc finger proteins constitute one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators in plants (Ciftci-Yilmaz and Mittler, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Proteins containing zinc finger domains which play important roles in eukaryotic cells, regulating different signal transduction pathways and controlling processes such as development (Colasanti et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), homeostasis (Devaiah et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and abiotic stress responses (Rizhsky et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Sakamoto et al., <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Davletova et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Some floral regulators contain a zinc-finger domain such as <italic>CONSTANS</italic> (<italic>CO</italic>), which has been linked to floral induction in several species by integrating the circadian clock and light signals (Putterill et al., <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; B&#x000f6;hlenius et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).

These TF are involved in, among others, wound and stress responses (De Pater et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Smolen et al., <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Chinnusamy et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kiribuchi et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), hormonal regulation (Abe et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Friedrichsen et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) stigma and anther development, and fruit development and differentiation (Rajani and Sundaresan, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Liljegren et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Sz&#x000e9;csi et al., <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gremski et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). From the differentially expressed bHLH genes in <italic>Q. suber</italic> floral libraries, three were up-regulated in male flowers. One was the homolog of <italic>ABORTED MICROSPORES</italic>, a gene essential to the development of pollen (Sorensen et al., <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The other two <italic>QsbHLH</italic> are homologs to genes associated with iron deficiency (Wang et al., <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In female flowers, nine <italic>Q. suber</italic> transcripts were significantly more expressed, with one transcript being exclusive to the female samples (<italic>QsBR ENHANCED EXPRESSION 1</italic>). In <italic>A. thaliana, BEE1</italic> is involved in the brassinosteroids signaling and associated with the development of the reproductive tract (Crawford and Yanofsky, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Homologs for <italic>GLABRA3, MYC2, INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1</italic>, and <italic>IAA LEUCINE RESISTANT3</italic> were also up-regulated in female flowers. These genes are involved in hormonal regulation, cold acclimation, cell fate and double fertilization (Bernhardt et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Chinnusamy et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Yadav et al., <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Rampey et al., <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Dombrecht et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). However, there were three bHLH transcripts differentially expressed whose function is yet to be characterized in other species, making them good candidates at least to be involved in carpel development.</p></sec><sec><title>Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) TF family</title><p>The bZIP TFs regulate diverse biological processes in plants including flower development (Jakoby et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Eight <italic>Q. suber</italic> bZIP associated genes were differentially expressed in female samples. Among them is the homolog of <italic>VIP1</italic>, an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> bZIP TF that regulates pathogen responses and rehydration responses (Tzfira et al., <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Tsugama et al., <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Another bZIP TF up-regulated in female samples is the homolog of <italic>PERIANTHIA</italic> (<italic>PAN</italic>), a gene involved in flower development in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> by altering floral organ number and initiation pattern (Running and Meyerowitz, <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Wynn et al., <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). <italic>PAN</italic> is also involved in the activation of the C-class MADS box protein <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> (<italic>AG</italic>), a gene essential for carpel development (Das et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Maier et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CUC/NAM TF family</title><p>Data also showed several <italic>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON/NO APICAL MERISTEM</italic> (<italic>CUC/NAM</italic>) genes highly represented in female flowers and the majority of them is differentially expressed. The <italic>CUC/NAM</italic> family encloses genes that control boundary formation and lateral organ separation, which are critical for proper leaf and floral patterning (Aida et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Vroemen et al., <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). A <italic>CUC/NAM</italic> gene in <italic>Medicago trunculata</italic> is needed for proper regulation of floral organ identity (Cheng et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Also, in <italic>A. thaliana, Petunia</italic> and rice, mutants for <italic>CUC/NAM</italic> genes lead to the fusion of the cotyledons and some floral organs, as well as severe defects of the primary apical meristem (Souer et al., <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Aida et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Mao et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Out of <italic>QsCUC/NAM</italic> genes that are differentially expressed, homologs for <italic>CUC1</italic> and <italic>CUC2</italic> genes were up-regulated in female flowers.</p></sec><sec><title>MADS-box TF family</title><p>The MADS family of TF include a group of genes that play prominent roles in plant development (Smaczniak et al., <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Particularly, MADS TFs were found to be crucial for proper flower development in several species across the angiosperm lineage (reviewed in Theissen and Melzer, <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). According to the canonical ABC model, which explains how homeotic genes control flower identity, stamens are formed by the activity of the B-Class and a C-class gene, whereas the same C-class is responsible for carpel development (Coen and Meyerowitz, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). As expected, B-class genes were differentially expressed in the male flowers (<italic>QsAPETALA3</italic> and <italic>QsPISTILLATA</italic>), and a similar level of expression of <italic>QsAGAMOUS</italic> (C-class gene) in both male and female libraries. The E-function genes (<italic>SEPALLATA1-4</italic>) that act as cadastral genes for proper organ development and identity (Pelaz et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) were also identified in both libraries but there was no sex differential expression. Several other homologs for MADS genes (Qs<italic>APETALA1, QsFRUITFUL, QsFLOWERING LOCUS</italic>, or <italic>QsSUPRESSOR OF CONSTANS1</italic>) that influence flowering in model and non-model species were also identified both in female and male libraries. Two transcripts similar to the <italic>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE</italic> gene were identified. It was interesting to detect a <italic>QsSVP</italic> gene differentially expressed in the female libraries and another in the male libraries. Genes of the <italic>SVP</italic> lineage in peach (<italic>dormancy-associated genes, DAM</italic>) are involved in growth cessation, bud set and break (Li et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Hormone related genes differentially expressed in female and male flowers</title><p>Flower development is strongly affected by hormonal regulation (reviewed in Chandler, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Auxin is tightly linked to the initiation of floral organ primordia and the disruption of auxin biosynthesis, polar auxin transport or auxin signaling leads to failure of flower formation (reviewed in Aloni et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In agreement, the floral meristem identity gene <italic>LEAFY</italic> was recently shown to act through the regulation of the auxin response pathway (Li et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Aux/IAA proteins, Auxin Efflux Carriers, and AUXIN RESPONSIVE FACTORS (ARF) are core components of the auxin-signaling cascade (Guilfoyle and Hagen, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Several genes associated with the auxin regulatory network are highly represented and several are differentially expressed in female flowers. Particularly, homologs for the <italic>A. thaliana IAA27</italic> and <italic>IAA9</italic> genes were differentially expressed. The latter is a gene involved in fruit development and leaf embryogenesis in tomato (Wang et al., <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) while mutants for <italic>IAA27</italic> showed altered fruit and flower development. A homolog of the <italic>ARF4</italic> gene that in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, together with <italic>ARF3</italic>, control perianth organ number and spacing, as well as organ borders (Sessions et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) was identified in female flowers. Mutants for these genes showed defects in the stamens and gynoecium, as well as in the perianth organs, indicating an involvement in regional identity determination (Sessions et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). An auxin efflux carrier <italic>QsPIN1</italic> was also found to be up-regulated 20 fold in female flowers. Loss of <italic>PIN1</italic> function severely affects organ initiation; <italic>pin1</italic> mutants are characterized by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem (Okada et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). The abundance of auxin related machinery in female tissues leads to the possibility that female tissue determination might be under strong control of this hormone. Another hormone strongly correlated with sex determination is ethylene (Byers et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Rudich et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). In cucumber, ethylene signaling is important in the inhibition of stamen development (Yamasaki et al., <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Interestingly, all the differentially expressed genes containing an ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (ERF) domain were detected in the female flowers, in agreement with the aforementioned role of ethylene in the feminization of the flower meristem. Another gene linked to ethylene signaling pathway is <italic>EIN3</italic>, a nuclear TF that initiates downstream transcriptional cascades for ethylene responses (Potuschak et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Yanagisawa et al., <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). <italic>QsEIN3</italic> was unique to the female samples. Interestingly in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, activated ethylene signaling reduces bioactive GA levels, thus enhancing the accumulation of DELLAs (repressors of the gibberellins pathway) and this most likely happens downstream of the transcriptional regulator <italic>EIN3</italic> (Achard et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This is very interesting because the gibberellin hormone is thought to be essential for the developmental of a fully functional stamen in several species like <italic>A. thaliana, Oryza sativa</italic> or <italic>Cucurbita maxima</italic> (Pimenta Lange and Lange, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). This goes in agreement with our RNAseq results, in which several gibberellin related genes are found exclusively in the male flowers equally expressed in early and late stages of the developmental program, indicating a role in floral primordia and anther differentiation. Also, a <italic>GAMYB</italic> firmly involved in anther development, <italic>QsMYB33</italic>, was only expressed in male samples (Millar and Gubler, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Interestingly, all the GRAS associated transcripts (known to be important regulators in GA signaling) that includes the gibberellin repressors DELLA, were only present in the female database.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monoecious and dioecious species have been long considered unique tools to study the developmental programs involved in the formation of separate male and female flowers. However, for the majority of these species, insufficient or inexistent genomic and transcriptomic data availability has hampered functional studies. Advances in NGS technologies have made possible to perform a rapid and cost-effective compilation of large RNA sequence data sets in non-model organisms with no or little prior genomic data available. Here, a broad flowering transcriptome composed of four independent libraries was obtained for early and late developmental stages of male and female flowers of <italic>Q. suber</italic>, a monoecious tree. In the future, to further enhance our knowledge on sex-specific genetic networks, individual EST libraries could be obtained for each phenological stage to fine map male and female flower specific regulators. Comparative studies revealed a subset of transcripts that were differentially expressed in the different libraries, many of which have a known role in flower and/or plant development. Transcriptome analysis also revealed a group of genes expressed exclusively in each type of flower gender that may have a functional role in male and female flower organ development or in sex specification. Some of the genes that showed differential expression have not been previously characterized in other species and others have not, to our knowledge, been implicated in flower development. Thus, it would be very interesting to perform functional studies using the above mentioned genes to identify its roles in plant reproduction or flower development in <italic>Q. suber</italic> and other flowering species. The analysis of <italic>Q. suber</italic> flower transcriptome may therefore contribute to uncover sex-specific regulatory networks hidden by hermaphroditism and serve as a platform to future studies in model and non-model species independently of their sexual habit.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Leonor Morais-Cec&#x000ed;lio, Maria M.
