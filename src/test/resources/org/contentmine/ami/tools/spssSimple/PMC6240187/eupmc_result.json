    "Background:Previous study revealed that rs2232618 polymorphism (Phe436Leu) within LBP gene is a functional variant and associated with susceptibility of sepsis in traumatic patients. Our aim was to confirm the reported association by enlarging the population sample size and perform a meta-analysis to find additional evidence. Methods:Traumatic patients from Southwest (n = 1296) and Southeast (n = 445) of China were enrolled in our study. After genotyping, the relationship between rs2232618 and the risk of sepsis was analyzed. Furthermore, we proceeded with a comprehensive literature search and meta-analysis to determine whether the rs2232618 polymorphism conferred susceptibility to sepsis. Results:Significance correlation was observed between rs2232618 and risk of sepsis in Southwest patients (P = 0.002 for the dominant model, P = 0.006 for the recessive model). The association was confirmed in Southeast cohort (P = 0.005 for the dominant model) and overall combined cohorts (P = 4.5 × 10-4, P = 0.041 for the dominant and recessive model). Multiple logistical regression analyses suggested that rs2232618 polymorphism was related to higher risk of sepsis (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.26-2.48, P = 0.001 in Southwest patients; OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.24-3.58, P = 0.006 in Southeast cohort; OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.34-2.08, P = 0.006 in overall cohort). Furthermore, meta-analysis of four studies (including the present study) confirmed that rs2232618 within LBP increased the risk of sepsis (OR = 1.75, P < 0.001 for the dominant model; OR = 6.08, P = 0.003 for the recessive model; OR = 2.72, P < 0.001 for the allelic model). Conclusions:The results from our replication study and meta-analysis provided firm evidence that rs2232618T allele significantly increased the risk of sepsis."
