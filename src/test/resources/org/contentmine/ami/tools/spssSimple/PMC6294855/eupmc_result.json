    "Background:Several studies have investigated the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among the general population in several parts of China. However, the results have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the overall prevalence of AD between 2007 and 2017 in China. Methods:English and Chinese electronic databases were searched with a date range from Nov 2007 to Nov 2017 and the reference lists of the included studies were screened as well. Cross-sectional studies addressing the prevalence of AD among the general Chinese population were retrieved irrespective of the age, location or sex of the participants. Study quality was assessed using the recommended checklist of STROBE. Results:Overall, 184058 subjects and 7445 patients with AD were included from 17 studies in this meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of AD in China was calculated to be 0.04(95% CI:0.04-0.05). The prevalence was higher in older age groups, among females, and in the rural areas of the country, with an increasing trend in recent years. Conclusion:AD is a common problem among those in the Chinese population older than 65 yr. Furthermore, an increasing trend of the disease over the past 10 years is indicative of a critical public health problem in China in the near future. Further evidence based on a national survey is needed to estimate the exact prevalence of the disease in the country."
