    "BACKGROUND:Breast disease has been a global serious health problem, among women. Surgery is the main treatment for the patients suffering from breast disease. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are still disturbing. Acupoint stimulation, an effective treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. Recently, non-needle acupoint stimulation becomes a new intervention. Though several clinical trials have been done, there is still no final conclusion on the efficacy. This Meta-Analysis aims at evaluating the efficacy of non-needle acupoint stimulation for prevention of nausea and vomiting after breast surgery. METHODS:Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Wanfang Med Online databases for studies. The review period covered from the inception of databases to December 31, 2017. The outcome measures of interest were frequency of nausea, frequency of vomiting, frequency of PONV, verbal rating scale of nausea, and use of rescue antiemetic. Data extraction and risks of bias evaluation were accomplished by 2 independent reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3.5). RESULTS:Fourteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 1009 female participants in the non-needle acupoint stimulation group and control group met the inclusion criteria. Although the therapeutically effect on vomiting within postoperative 2 hours was not obvious, non-needle acupoint stimulation still had an important role in reducing nausea and vomiting within postoperative 48 hours. According to Jadad scale, there was moderate quality evidence for the pooled analysis results in this study. In addition, stimulating acupoint by wristband acupressure was more likely to cause adverse reactions. CONCLUSION:Non-needle acupoint stimulation can be used for female patients undergoing breast surgery to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. Into consideration, we recommend transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation on PC6 from 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia to the end of surgery for application. This non-pharmaceutical approach may be promising to promote the recovery of patients after breast surgery."
