Surgery is the main treatment for the patients suffering from breast disease. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are still disturbing. Acupoint stimulation, an effective treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. Recently, non-needle acupoint stimulation becomes a new intervention. Though several clinical trials have been done, there is still no final conclusion on the efficacy. This Meta-Analysis aims at evaluating the efficacy of non-needle acupoint stimulation for prevention of nausea and vomiting after breast surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Wanfang Med Online databases for studies. The review period covered from the inception of databases to December 31, 2017. The outcome measures of interest were frequency of nausea, frequency of vomiting, frequency of PONV, verbal rating scale of nausea, and use of rescue antiemetic. Data extraction and risks of bias evaluation were accomplished by 2 independent reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3.5).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>Fourteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 1009 female participants in the non-needle acupoint stimulation group and control group met the inclusion criteria. Although the therapeutically effect on vomiting within postoperative 2&#x0200a;hours was not obvious, non-needle acupoint stimulation still had an important role in reducing nausea and vomiting within postoperative 48&#x0200a;hours. According to Jadad scale, there was moderate quality evidence for the pooled analysis results in this study. In addition, stimulating acupoint by wristband acupressure was more likely to cause adverse reactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Non-needle acupoint stimulation can be used for female patients undergoing breast surgery to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. Into consideration, we recommend transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation on PC6 from 30&#x0200a;minutes before induction of anesthesia to the end of surgery for application. This non-pharmaceutical approach may be promising to promote the recovery of patients after breast surgery.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>acupoint</kwd><kwd>breast</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>nausea</kwd><kwd>non-needling stimulation</kwd><kwd>PONV</kwd><kwd>vomiting</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to advances in diagnostic techniques, diagnosis of breast disease is getting easier.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> As the main part of this disease, breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> From that, breast disease has been a global serious health problem. Surgery seems to be the only alternative for the patients suffering from most of breast cancers, some kinds of benign breast diseases, and breast reconstruction. Although the curative effect of breast surgery is improving deeply, postoperative complications are still disturbing.</p><p>Among the postoperative complications, nausea and vomiting are important ones. Currently, the term &#x0201c;postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)&#x0201d; is often defined as nausea or vomiting within 24&#x0200a;hours after surgery. It has an incidence of 20% to 30% after anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Current thinking suggests that four primary risk predictors including female gender, history of motion sickness, nonsmoking, and the use of postoperative opioids are related to the PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Method and duration of anesthesia, and medications used during the surgical procedures are also known be related to PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Due to the gender specificity, breast surgery is often followed by a high incidence of PONV. Some reports showed that about 47% to 80% of patients undergoing minor breast surgery, mastectomy, and breast reconstruction suffer from PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Except for discomfort feelings, PONV can lead to aspiration, wound dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, dehydration, exhaustion, electrolyte imbalance, mobilization delay, slow recovery, and disability to begin oral medications.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> In addition, PONV increases health care costs including prolonging hospital stay and unexpected hospitalization of outpatient surgery patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Although application of antiemetic drugs is widespread, the side-effects including headache, constipation, and abdominal pain always promotes the patients&#x02019; suffering.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Non-pharmaceutical and safe method is better suited to the requirements of current medical development. Therefore, the new settlement of PONV becomes critical for patients undergoing breast surgery. Unfortunately, the best answer is still in the pending.</p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), especially acupuncture, plays a positive role in prophylaxis and treatment of PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> It has been confirmed that acupoints such as Neiguan (PC6), Laogong (PC8), Waiguan (SJ5) Zusanli (ST36), Hegu (LI4), and Quchi (LI11) can be used for reducing PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> The basic theory of action mechanism is related to activating meridians by acupuncture.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Acupoints could be stimulated by acupuncture needle, electrical stimulation, and acupressure and so on. The use of traditional acupuncture was subject to the treatment experience. However, with the continuous simplification and commercialization, non-needle acupoint stimulation including electroacupuncture and acupressure are gradually substituted for the traditional acupuncture and have been common nursing methods. Effectively reducing the incidence of postoperative complications, electroacupuncture, and acupressure instruments have been widely applied to patients in the clinical nursing work. Major therapeutic purposes of non-needle acupoint stimulation include reducing PONV, decreasing postoperative pain and improving gastrointestinal function.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> The effect of acupoint stimulation on reducing PONV is studied most, mainly involving breast surgery, abdominal surgery, caesarean section and thyroidectomy.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Since the new method was introduced to the recovery after breast surgery, several clinical trials have been done for unveiling the truth. However, there is still no final conclusion on the efficacy of non-needle acupoint stimulation as an intervention for reducing PONV. Here, we performed this review of the included studies to reveal the role of non-needle acupoint stimulation on PONV.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This review was reported according to the PRISMA statement.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Ethical approval was not necessary for this review study.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Database and search strategy</title><p>We searched the following databases from their inception through December 31, 2017: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Wanfang Med Online databases.

Here, due to the characteristic of acupoint stimulation RCTs, other bias was defined as whether the study introduced the detailed operation method. Three levels were used to evaluate the trials: low risk of bias (all the items were in low risk of bias), high risk of bias (at least 1 item was in high risk of bias) and unclear risk of bias (at least 1 item was in unclear risk of bias). For examples, as for &#x0201c;low risk&#x0201d; of bias for the domain of random sequence generation, the investigators should describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator or coin tossing.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager V5.3.

However, the safe and effective method still remains unknown.</p><p>Acupoint stimulation is a complex, ritualistic somatosensory intervention with multiple components. Acupuncture is an original and important method of acupoint stimulation. Along with the development of TCM, more and more researchers apply acupoint stimulation to settle complications after treatment. Because of the particularity of acupuncture, reliance on skilled acupuncturist becomes the crucial part of treatment as well as limits the dissemination and generalization. The problem has been resolved, since instrumented replacements of acupuncture like transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation and acupressure are widely used to reduce postoperative complications. Particularly, studies about nausea and vomiting with satisfactory curative effects can often be found.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup></p><p>According to TCM constitutional theory, most of patients undergoing breast surgery have Qi-stagnation constitution or Qi-deficiency constitution.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> And patients with PONV often have Qi-deficiency constitution. By stimulating acupoints, meridian and collaterals could be activated to tonify and promote Qi. Neiguan, for example, is an important acupoint of pericardium meridian, which has an effect on regulating Qi and decreasing inverse. Additionally, stimulating Laogong, Waiguan, Zusanli, Hegu or Quchi could also be used for reducing PONV by activating different meridians. Therefore, theoretically, acupoint stimulation may prevent nausea and vomiting after breast surgery. In response to this, some clinical researches have been done to explore practical effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Unfortunately, conclusions from these researches are not the same. Comprehensive summary and analysis become more urgent.</p><p>Through rigorous reviewing and screening, we finally collected 14 trials to complete a meta-analysis to explore the result whether acupoint stimulation could have effect on reducing PONV after the breast surgery or not. In this review, unclear risk of bias was found in most of the included trails. Description of blind method and allocation concealment were the main reason that was prone to prevent the analysis of a subjective outcome. Jadad scale was applied to assess all selected trials, a high-quality study should have the Jadad score equal to or more than 3.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> All of included studies had the Jadad score no less than 2. There were nine trials with Jadad score 2. Combining particularity of acupoint stimulation and elaborative evaluation, reviewers found that design and implementation of these trials were reasonable and reliable. Therefore, these trials with Jadad score 2 were also included. These enrolling criteria allowed us a moderate quality analysis.</p><p>Methods of evaluating nausea and vomiting mainly include frequency, VRS of nausea, and use of rescue antiemetic. Here, the included outcomes were within PO48H. According to the results of analysis, nausea could be reduced by acupoint stimulation in the early phase after breast surgery (0-12H). However, acupoint stimulation had no reducing effect on vomiting at the same time. Nausea was often treated as the early symptom of vomiting. From the data of included studies, the frequency of vomiting in the early phase was less than other phases. This reasonably explained why pooled analysis did not support the effectiveness of acupoint stimulation for reducing vomiting. PO24H was thought to be the medium phase in this study. Frequency of PONV, frequency of nausea, and frequency of vomiting were selected to assess the curative effect of acupoint stimulation in the early and medium phases (0-24H). Analysis results kept consistency showing that acupoint stimulation was able to markedly reduce the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. In this period, frequency of nausea and vomiting increased. Although there was the difference of included patients, those research results about other kinds of surgery still supported our viewpoint.<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> Analyzing the outcome of nausea within PO24H, we only found heterogeneity appearing in this result. Then, according to the classification of non-needle acupoint stimulation, a subgroup analysis was completed and showed no heterogeneity. Between electrical stimulation and acupressure, there may be some differences such as operation, curative effect and so on. This explained the reason of the existence of heterogeneity. Within PO48H, the possibility of nausea and vomiting continues to increase for postoperative patients. The pooled analysis of 2 outcomes including nausea and vomiting suggested the effect of non-needle acupoint stimulation on reducing nausea and vomiting after breast surgery continue until PO48H. In addition, adverse events were reported in only 1 included study, which adopted wristbands to stimulating acupoint. However, these commercialized wristbands caused redness, swelling, tenderness and paresthesias. The occurrence of adverse events was related to tight wearing.</p><p>In terms of the choice of non-needle acupoint stimulation, electrical stimulation was more popular. The most common acupoint is PC6 that was selected in all the included studies. This was in line with trends in research that often recommended PC6 as the acupoint to prevent nausea and vomiting. Acupoint selection could be either bilateral or unilateral. Meanwhile, other acupoints also could be chose to play a synergistic role of reducing nausea and vomiting. Working time was generally specified as from 30&#x0200a;minutes before induction of anaesthesia to the end of surgery. When electrical stimulation was selected, working electric current was different among various instruments. Without the need of professional acupuncturist, non-needle acupoint stimulation has been gradually popularized in clinical nursing practice and revealed the potential of replacing antiemetic. Moreover, there was an inevitable question that the use of acupressure is often limited to wristband structures that cause uncomfortable or tight feelings.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> The presentation of adverse events may lead to reduce the usage of acupoint stimulation by wristband. Therefore, transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation seems safer than acupressure by wristband acupressure.</p><p>Most of studies that were included in this review had unclear risk of bias, recruited a small number of patients, and provided sparse data on most of our pre-established outcomes of interest. So, the pooling results in these meta-analyses were affected. Heterogeneity existed in the aspects of type of surgery, duration of surgery and anesthesia. From the viewpoint of gastrointestinal stimulation and nervous stimulation, laparoscopic abdominal surgery, gynecological surgery, and procedures involving the ear, nose and throat were easier to induce PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> However, the difference of increasing PONV among different breast surgeries could not be ignored. Duration of surgery always had effect on incidence of PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> Here, due to the selection of different breast surgery, the duration of surgery varied greatly from study to study. Anesthetic agents were also related to PONV. The use of anesthetic inhalation agents like nitrous oxide has long been associated with an increase in the risk of PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> On the contrary, total intravenous anesthetic using propofol has been found to reduce PONV.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> Therefore, heterogeneity in anesthetic agents was obvious in the included studies. Furthermore, there were only 2 studies about acupressure. Others selected electroacupuncture as the therapeutic method for PONV. For reducing PONV of breast surgery, the different between acupressure and electroacupuncture was no conclusion. But heterogeneity in acupoint stimulation methods could not be ignored, too.</p><p>To some extent, this had an effect on the final result of meta-analysis. The main methodological limitations of these included studies were the lack of description of allocation concealment, blinding of participants, and outcome assessors; which were due to the characteristic of non-needle acupoint stimulation. Due to the different publication standard, risk of bias in English trials was lower than that in Chinese trials. In addition, the inclusion criteria of patients in different studies was inconsistent, especially in age, history of nausea and vomiting, type of breast disease and surgery, the duration of surgery and use of anesthetic drug. Further studies with more consistent measurements and more standard data records would help to more accurately confirm the final conclusion.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this meta-analysis of fourteen relatively studies showed that non-needle acupoint stimulation was an effective method for reducing nausea and vomiting of female patients after breast surgery. Because of the limited number and quality of included studies, this conclusion could not be considered a conclusive statement. As one of the most commonly used non-pharmaceutical therapy, acupoint stimulation was especially suitable for solving PONV by nurses. It could be recommended in patients undergoing breast surgery with moderate-high risk for PONV or drugs contraindications. The routine operation was application of transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation on PC6 from 30&#x0200a;minutes before induction of anesthesia to the end of surgery. The comparison among various methods and different stimulating acupoints will be a meaningful topic for future studies. Although the quantity of Chinese studies about acupoint stimulation mounted up, more well-designed studies should be carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed this meta-analysis: STY, SMZ and SR.
