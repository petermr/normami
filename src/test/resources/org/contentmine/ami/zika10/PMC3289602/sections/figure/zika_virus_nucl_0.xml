  <p>Neighbor-joining phylogeny generated from open reading frame nucleotide sequences of Zika virus strains. The tree was rooted with Spondweni virus (GenBank accession number DQ859064). The scale at the bottom of the tree represents genetic distance in nucleotide substitutions per site. Numbers at the nodes represent percent bootstrap support values based on 1,000 replicates. Isolates are represented according to strain name, country of origin, and year of isolation. The lineage of each virus is indicated to the right of the tree. *Strains sequenced in this study.</p>
