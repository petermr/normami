The African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) Scientific Conference, is a perfect opportunity for public health professionals from various sectors and organizations to come together to discuss issues that impact on public health in Africa. This year's conference was organized by the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute in collaboration with the Ethiopia Ministry of Health, Ethiopian Public Health Association (EPHA), Ethiopia Field Epidemiology Training Program (EFETP), Addis Ababa University (AAU), Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET) and AFENET. Participants at this year's conference numbered 400 from over 20 countries including; Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen and Zimbabwe. The topics covered in the 144 oral presentations included: global health security, emergency response, public health informatics, vaccine preventable diseases, immunization, outbreak investigation, Millennium Development Goals, Non-Communicable Diseases, and public health surveillance. The theme for the 5th AFENET Scientific Conference was; &#x0201c;Addressing Public Health Priorities in Africa through FELTPs.&#x0201d; Previous AFENET Scientific conferences have been held in: Accra, Ghana (2005), Kampala, Uganda (2007), Mombasa, Kenya (2009) and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (2011).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Conference</kwd><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>field epidemiology</kwd><kwd>FELTP</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><sub-article id="sub01"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Guest Speakers</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Global Health Security: Opportunities and Challenges</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stanley</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date></article-meta></front><body><p>Dr Claire Stanley, gave an overview of the history of global health security. She talked about promoting health, peace, stability and security. She said that Global Health Security often falls into the umbrella of what we call bio-risk management and is a combination of bio safety and bio security. According to Dr Stanley, bio safety is protecting people and the environment from dangerous pathogens whereas bio-security is about ensuring the agents are secured against misuse. She talked about Bio Security Engagement Program which works on health and security. Overall, the program tries to decrease the likelihood that dangerous pathogens intentionally or naturally cause a dangerous outbreak. She gave examples of outbreaks like &#x0201c;Black Death&#x0201d; or plague in Europe (caused by <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>) which caused major socio-economic chaos, smallpox introduced in the early times and more recently of anthrax attacks, the HIV/AIDS, pandemic, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="sub02"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Guest Speakers</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Global Health Security and Emergency Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Borchert</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date></article-meta></front><body><p>Dr. Jeff Borchert spoke about biological threats that occur naturally, are intentionally produced, or are a result of laboratory accidents which constitute a growing international threat to humans in the global economy. He shared a case which happened in north-western Uganda a year ago. The case was a story of a mother who died sometime after she lost her son to &#x0201c;pneumonic plague&#x0201d;, a dangerous contagious disease. Besides, her friend died 24 hrs after the boy's burial. After the local team from Uganda's Virus Research Institute performed a blood test and found out that the result was positive for plague, they treated the villagers who were assumed to have been exposed to the disease with antibiotics. He also said global health security involves preventing an outbreak from getting out of control and that disease outbreaks indicate that we are all connected and in some ways we are all at risk. He also stated that outbreaks that happen anywhere in the world can be a risk for people everywhere in the world. He mentioned that globalization of travel food supply, rise in drug resistance including drug resistant TB were some of the sources of global security threats. He also talked about CDC's approach and implementation of global health security, and its demonstration projects in Uganda. He added that the good global health securities must make the world safe and secure from global health threats caused by infectious diseases by preventing naturally occurring outbreaks, detecting and reporting outbreaks and creating global networks that can respond effectively and mediating human suffering and loss of life that can negatively impact the economy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="sub03"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Guest Speakers</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Life and Death in Sub Saharan Africa</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mensah</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date></article-meta></front><body><p>Dr Mensah made a video presentation of his key note speech. He began by talking about research for health in Africa. He highlighted the scarcity of ideal local data on life and death in Africa and the crucial role of field epidemiology. His presentation then focused on the key findings of the global burden of disease in Africa and its implications. He highlighted the 2008 Bamako Call to action for research for health and mentioned the two of the principles in the document. These were: Principle 7: To strengthen health data, strengthen skill set for data analysis, planning and monitoring and Principle 8: Strengthening health research capacity and build critical mass of young researchers</p><p>Every nation should have a comprehensive research agenda at all levels. Most Sub Saharan African Countries lack national vital registration systems or local level data to inform policy decisions. Most births and deaths are unrecorded. As a result, the regional health policies are not really informed by population based data. For example, only about 1% of deaths in low-income countries are reported. In 2012, only 42/46 countries in WHO Africa had no vital registration systems at all compared to over 95% in developed countries. Due to these poor records, many of the projections in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) are not very reliable and predictions of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) and other Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are perhaps exaggerated.</p><p>Many lessons can be drawn from the 2010 Global Disease Burden (GDB) study in SSA. The study showed a massive increase in many chronic NCDs between 2004 and 2030. However, these findings mask what is in SSA. The reality is 80% chronic diseases happen in SSA. The major divers of chronic disease are lifestyle and behaviour changes, nutritional transition, physical inactivity and demographic and epidemiologic transition. For example, in many parts of SSA, there is increase in adverts of fast foods and smoking of tobacco including among women.</p><p>The GDB data shows a systematic effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss for 187 countries from 1990-2010 covering 291 diseases. The study identified key drivers of rapid changes in global health patterns. These were: demographic transition, cause of death transition shift from communicable to NCD, disability transition to disease that cause disability but not mortality and risk transition- shift from risks related to poverty to those of lifestyle.</p><p>On average, there was a substantial increase in the mean age of death in all SSA countries, but the causes of death had not changed substantially. They are still communicable diseases; malaria, HIV/ AIDS and lower respiratory diseases. The major causes of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in males were underweight, indoor pollution, poor feeding, alcohol and diet. In most countries outside SSA, the DALYS from NCDs exceed 60%. Malaria, HIV/AIDS, and underweight are still responsible for most deaths and disabilities. However, there is no evidence of pandemic of NCDs. The major changes from 1990 to 2010 data include decline in major nutritional deficiencies and sanitation, while there have been increases in alcohol use, hypertension.</p><p>In conclusion, Dr Mensah stated that the scarcity of ideal data on births and deaths calls for renewed investments in epidemiology and vital registrations. The leading causes of deaths in the last 20 years have remained unchanged over the last 20 years. The overall mortality is decreasing and life expectancy has increased over last 40 years while deaths from measles and tetanus have plummeted. Although there have been dramatic declines in deaths from diarrheal disease and lower respiratory infections, some age groups are facing an increase in mortality. The use of alcohol, tobacco and hypertension are on the rise. However, health promotion and primary prevention remain preeminent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="sub04"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Guest Speakers</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bejtullahu</surname><given-names>Armand</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date></article-meta></front><body><p>The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) is a global technical partnership, coordinated by WHO whose focus is outbreak response.

He mentioned that IT changes the way in which we work, interact, communicate, generate information and use information. There are many factors that interact in various ways to affect the health outcomes of individuals within this group. These factors can be distal factors, for example, poverty and education, to more proximal factors like diet, activity, smoking, to physiological factors. You can also think of these factors as layers.</p><p>If we are to develop an understanding of how we get to these outcomes as a result of interactions between these factors, we need to be able to quantify these factors and their interactions so we can design interventions that can effectively and efficiently impact key leverage points. In the end, we cannot improve what we do not measure. For us to be able to do these measurements, we need to be able to systematically collect, manage, analyze and use data about these various factors.</p><p>We cannot improve what we do not measure. Public health is data and information driven enterprise. Data are transformed into information which is turned into knowledge for informed decision making. Public health informatics addresses public health information challenges. There is a basic knowledge-to-action assumption in public health. Measuring population parameters is a prerequisite for knowledge generation. We measure and we know, and act on what we know. Sometimes we know and we cannot act because of several factors: competing priorities, apathy, governance, limited capacities among others.</p><p>Health Information Systems (HIS) have always occupied a central role into public health practice. Because of the assumption that more information and better information is needed for good public health practice, there has been a renewed emphasis for HIS development in developing countries.</p><p>Dr Kamadjeu highlighted the challenges of the aging information systems in public health that include: difficulty pulling data out of information systems, repetitive data collection, with little reuse, investing in information systems and not meet information needs resulting in wastage of resources and data silos which may offer many opportunities for reuse but fail to do so.</p><p>Public Health Informatics (PHI) is the systematic application of knowledge about systems that capture, manage, analyze and use information to improve population health. Dr Kamadjeu stated the principles of PHI which include engage all stakeholders, put the logical before the physical, plan for interoperability and manage for accountability (borrowed from Dave Ross of the Public Health Informatics Institute)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="sub07"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Guest Speakers</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Vaccine Preventable Diseases Surveillance and Response: The Role of a Public Health Institute</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kebede</surname><given-names>Amha</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date></article-meta></front><body><p>Dr. Kebede gave a presentation on the role of a public health institute. He mentioned that the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNRI) works closely with FMoH. The institute gathers evidence based on its research findings; it manages public health emergency; conducts health and health related surveys &#x00026; surveillances; it supports the national laboratory system; it vaccinates and diagnoses productions and generates key health related performance indicators (KPI). Dr. Amha also pointed out WHO's estimation regarding annual death occurrence among infants and children who are below the age of 5, which is 8.8 million. From this figure 20% of death were due to vaccine-preventable diseases.</p><p>Pneumococcal diseases, Hib, pertussis, measles and tetanus are among the high-burden VPDs which cause high mortality in the Africa Region. However, because of vaccination, the number of cases has decreased by up to 100 percent for diseases like smallpox, diphtheria, polio (paralytic) and CRS. Dr. Amha mentioned that in 1980, Ethiopia launched EPI against measles, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis, <italic>Hemophilus influenza</italic>, rota virus, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. In the 2012/13, immunization coverage of Ethiopia for Pentavalent 3 was 87.6%, PCV3-80.4%, Measles-83.2% and full immunization-77.7%. Dr. Amha noted that there are 20 priority diseases and conditions under surveillance in Ethiopia of which 50% are vaccine preventable. These diseases are categorized in to two; immediately reportable and weekly reportable. AFP, anthrax, avian human Influenza, cholera, dracunculiasis/guinea worm, measles, neonatal tetanus, H1N1, rabies, small pox, SARS, viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) and yellow fever which are categorized under immediately reportable. Diseases such as dysentery, malaria, meningitis, relapsing fever, typhoid fever, typhus and severe acute malnutrition are categorized under weekly reportable. This category is made according to high epidemic potential, international concern, targeted for eradication or elimination, public health importance and effective prevention and control measures.</p><p>Guidelines and plans to address these diseases are in place. Two case detection tools which are also called case definitions were presented as samples. There are also different reporting formats such as weekly reporting, case based reporting, case based laboratory reporting, line list reporting, daily epidemic reporting and GW Investigation reporting format as well as AFP case investigation form, rumor log book and E-PHEM. Immediately reportable diseases should be reported to the health center then to the woreda (district), then to the region and finally to EHNRI within two hours which means the reporting should only take 30 minutes from one place to the other. There is treatment at the health facility all week and the time line for weekly reportable diseases should be; Monday the report should go from the health facility to the wereda (district), on Tuesday from the woreda to the zone, on Wednesday from the zone to the region and on Thursday from the region to EHNRI. Dr, Amha said that he obtained the above information about the timeline from Public Health Emergency Management Guideline for Ethiopia 2012.</p><p>Telephone, fax, e-mail and rumors are the means of communication that Dr. Amha mentioned during his presentation. These channels can be used to pass the report from the health facilities to the woreda and then to the zone and finally to EHNRI.</p><p>Data management takes place through data entry and compilation, analysis and interpretation and dissemination of bulletin and collection of feedback. When there is an alert or warning that needs to be communicated to the community, then public media (TV, radio and magazine), brochures and letters can be used. Laboratory diagnosis takes place to detect diseases, to confirm outbreaks and identify genetic and characterization of strains. Polio, measles, rubella, hepatitis, influenza, yellow fever, rotavirus and meningitis can be diagnosed in the laboratory. Rapid assessment, establishment and training of rapid response teams and outbreak investigation conducted on epidemiological and laboratory diseases. Besides, coordination between Ministry of Health, EHNRI, some agencies and PHEMC took place to mobilize resource, share information and activity responses among one another. Dr. Amha also noted that, vaccination is provided for diseases such as Meningitis, Measles, Yellow Fever and Polio. Social Mobilization and Health Education uses to mobilize community and to create awareness among health workers.</p><p>Dr. Amha noted that for the case management to take place, treatment control should be provided. Besides, health workers should be trained and emergency drugs should be supplied. In order to prevent epidemic contamination, there is need to isolate and quarantine cases and suspects, conduct vector control, hygiene and sanitation. The post outbreak assessment identifies gaps and documents lessons learnt like preparedness, surveillance and response. The assessment also helps to implement corrective measures to prevent problems of similar outbreaks in the future. Dr. Amha concluded his presentation by noting that the public health research should contain vaccination coverage survey, sentinel surveillance and serological and entomological survey.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="sub08"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Guest Speakers</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Immunization in Africa: Progress and Challenges</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Berhane</surname><given-names>Yemane</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date></article-meta></front><body><p>Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) in Africa now focuses on building sustainable immunization systems to protect children against common VPDs, and serve as vehicle for other child survival interventions. The intervention initially distributed six vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, TB, and measles. Currently it integrates other vaccines: Yellow fever, hepatitis B, Hib, PCV, rotavirus vaccines, HPV, MenA, MCV2, etc. Prof. Yemane in his study showed that in 2011, 81% of non-vaccinated infants of the region are located in ten countries: Nigeria, Ethiopia, DRC, Chad, South Africa, Cameron, Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire, Mozambique and Niger. He also discussed WHO&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020&#x0201d;, which he stated as achieving a world free of Poliomyelitis, meeting the vaccination coverage in every region, country and community, exceeding the millennium development goal target for reduction of child mortality, meeting global and regional elimination targets and develop and introduce new and improved vaccines and technologies.</p><p>Prof. Yemane also indicated that the four main immunization program priorities i.e. Polio Eradication, Accelerate Disease Control, Reach the Unreached and Improve Data Quality. He also stated the five operational components of an EPI programme; Vaccine Supply &#x00026; Quality, Logistics, Service Delivery, Surveillance, Advocacy &#x00026; Communication. Additionally, the study shows that accurate and reliable data leads to improved decisions which again lead to efficient use of resources. Regarding issues related to immunization in Africa, Prof. Yemane pointed out sstrategies to increase routine immunisation coverage, monitoring epidemiology of VPD and tailoring strategies accordingly, advocacy and creation of demand for immunization, capacity for outbreak investigation and response, surveillance quality and documenting best practices, vaccination coverage data quality, introduction of new vaccines: when and how, strengthen advanced data analysis of routinely collected information and operational research are core methods to tackle the problems.</p><p>He also explained the major challenges of immunization in Africa and what the role of professional networks in reaching immunization targets could be. According to Prof. Yemane the challenges are stalling or receding routine immunization coverage, resurgence of measles outbreaks, resurgence of epidemic polio in the Horn-of-Africa, insufficient demand creation, weak links with communities and their leaders, insufficient human resource capacity at all levels with rapid turnover of staff, and gaps in supportive supervision, poor data quality/use for decision-making, lack of clear leadership and commitment, inadequate funding and inadequate supply and logistics systems. Training, research, advocacy and collaboration at program and health facility level through internship or other mechanisms are the roles of networks in reaching immunization targets suggested at the end of the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="sub09"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Oral Presentations</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Community Resistance to Oral Polio Vaccine in Nagero County, South Sudan</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jocker</surname><given-names>Mathew Lado</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF0001-sub09">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF0001-sub09"><label>1</label>Sudan Immunization and Field Epidemiology Training Project</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date><abstract><sec id="st1-sub09"><title>Background</title><p>The Republic of South Sudan (RSS) is made up of 10 states and 80 counties. Western Equatoria State (WES) experienced polio outbreak in 2009, of which 11 children were paralyzed. Nagero County is one of the 10 counties of WES. The county is sparsely populated and shares a long border with the Central African Republic, which puts RSS at risk for importation of polio. Based on national data from previous house-to-house vaccination campaigns, Nagero is has a high parental refusal rate against polio vaccine. During the March 2013 house-to-house campaign (NIDs), we conducted a study of households that refused to have their &#x0003c;5 children vaccinated.</p></sec><sec id="st2-sub09"><title>Methods</title><p>NID teams provided a list of households in 2 Payams that refused vaccination. We followed-up with those household to conduct face-to-face interviews with parents or adult caregivers.

Twenty percent of the children in those households were unvaccinated infants (&#x0003c;1 year old). All households (n = 43) consented to interview. Analyses of the interview data showed that parents refused due to 1) seeing or hearing about adverse events post-vaccination (53%), 2) thought all vaccines were dangerous (33%), or 3) held traditional beliefs that other medicines were more effective in protecting their children (27%). Additional analyses showed that some (20%) would refuse oral polio vaccine only, whereas another 20% would refuse all vaccines for their children. Follow-up interventions by NID teams did not convince any of the households to allow vaccination of their children.</p></sec><sec id="st4-sub09"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This snapshot of polio vaccine refusals is instructive. We see that the reasons for refusal are various, but are not so entrenched that tailored and specific community education and outreach efforts cannot overcome. Social mobilization and education should be strengthened to educate the community leaders, women's groups, and others to understand the role that vaccines play in keeping communities healthy. Involvement of high profile community leaders to address the issues of refusals within communities is also important.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub10"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Oral Presentations</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Investigation of a Measles Outbreak in the Nkolndongo health District, Yaound&#x000e9; Cameroon: A case-control study</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ebontane</surname><given-names>Ndode Corlins</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF0001-sub10">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF0001-sub10"><label>1</label>Central African Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date><abstract><sec id="st1-sub10"><title>Background</title><p>Measles is a highly infectious viral disease with children below 15 years being mostly at risk.

Evaluation of risks to mothers within health facilities during labor is required.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub25"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Oral Presentations</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Assessing the Leading Causes of Mortality in less than Five-year old Children in Migori District, Kenya, 2011</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mgamb</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF0001-sub25">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF0001-sub25"><label>1</label>Kenya Field Epidemiology and Laboratory and Training Program</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date><abstract><sec id="st1-sub25"><title>Background</title><p>Infant and child mortality remain high in developing countries where 12.9 million children die yearly. Around 70% of these deaths are due to conditions that could be prevented or treated with access to simple, affordable interventions. In Kenya, 33% of children who die before their fifth birthday come from Nyanza Province. We therefore sought to determine the leading cause of mortality in children less than five years in Migori District of Nyanza province.</p></sec><sec id="st2-sub25"><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed data of under five years old children who died in the year 2011and 2012 in the facilities offering in patient services in Migori District.

It is estimated to be responsible for more than 600,000 deaths worldwide each year. The existing smoking policies in Uganda are not effective. There's need for evidence to support 100% smoke free policies (SFPs). This study will help create demand for enforcing laws to establish 100% SFPs. Objectives: This study aimed at determining the prevalence of exposure, level of knowledge and attitudes towards second hand smoking (SHS) and its prevention in Kabarole District, Western Uganda. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out among secondary school students in Kabarole District. 2-stage Cluster sampling was used to select the schools and classes. All students in the selected classes were eligible to participate. A pre-tested, semi structured questionnaire was used. The data was analyzed using stata version 10. Results: Majority (93%) had good knowledge of SHS as well as its risks. However, high proportions (39.5% and 79.6%) of the participants were exposed to SHS from home and from elsewhere respectively. Majority (94.6%) appreciated the risk posed by SHS. 68% of the students appreciated that the existing policies were not obeyed and majority (over 80%) were in support of 100% SFPs.</p></sec><sec id="st4-sub41"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Secondary school students are generally knowledgeable about SHS and appreciate its dangers but are still highly exposed to it.

The Global Tobacco Surveillance System utilizes a standardized set of repeated surveys, including the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS), in order to measure the prevalence and characteristics of Tobacco use, identify risk factors, and monitor the effectiveness of interventions.

An estimated over 207 million people are infected worldwide, 90% in sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence ranges between 54.8% - 60% in Ghana, mostly along the Volta basin. The objectives of the Schistosomiasis surveillance system are to understand the magnitude and patterns of the disease, to monitor changes in trends in different geographical locations, to inform interventions and permit assessments of control measures. A 2010 evaluation of the system from 2008-2010 in the Eastern region showed that the northern region had the lowest (0.3%) prevalence and regional rates of completeness and timeliness of reporting.</p></sec><sec id="st2-sub57"><title>Methods</title><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems was used as reference. The point of entry was the Central Gonja District of the northern region, located along the Volta basin.

The region has the lowest prevalence, a possible effect of low regional timeliness and completeness of reporting. This measures the acceptability of the system in the region. The system is simple, representative, and useful with low specificity. Feedback to stakeholders after the evaluation called for an improvement in case detection, testing and acceptability of the system in the region. Seven suspected cases have been tested in the District from a previous zero. Use of community based volunteers along the Volta basin in the region will increase sensitivity and reporting.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub58"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Oral Presentations</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Explosive Measles Outbreak in Nyanza Province, Kenya 2012</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Onyango</surname><given-names>Dickens</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF0001-sub58">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF0001-sub58"><label>1</label>Kenya Field Epidemiology and Laboratory and Training Program</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date><abstract><sec id="st1-sub58"><title>Background</title><p>Globally, Measles is a leading cause of death in children younger than five years, it is responsible for 1% of deaths annually.

All cases reported fever and headache, 95% reported arthralgia and 64% joint swelling. The highest incidence rate of 10/1000 was among active age group of 25-29 years. Around half of cases concentrated in the fish market area with an attack rate 78/1000 (108/1377) which is supporting the hypotheses that infection was imported by fishermen coming from Al-Hudieda costal governorate where the first CHIK outbreak was reported.

We used the CDC guidelines for evaluating surveillance systems as reference for the evaluation of attributes and the usefulness of the system.</p></sec><sec id="st3-sub73"><title>Results</title><p>The system's flow chart is simple with 34(94.4%) of the 36 respondents having good mastery of the case definition. Twenty-seven (75%) accepted that surveillance activities make up part of their routine task. The system is supported by WHO and CDC. It is flexible as the form could notify other diseases. Data quality showed that, out of 73 056 spaces on the form 58 402 (79.94%) were filled. All the forms were counterchecked by a different person for validity. The system operated uninterrupted from 2007 to 2011, making it stable. For sensitivity, only 1664(43.6%) were captured out of 3819 registered cases during these five years, and 621 of them were confirmed by EIA giving a positive predictive value of 37%. The system was useful in determining the most affected age groups, and the seasonality of the rotavirus strains circulating in Yaound&#x000e9;.</p></sec><sec id="st4-sub73"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The surveillance of rotavirus gastroenteritis at the MCC is simple, acceptable, flexible, stable, and useful. However its positive predictive value and sensitivity were unsatisfactory. Data quality was good.

In 2008, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH) mandated all hospitals to notify, and review report maternal deaths occurring at their facilities to the MOH. Data from maternal death review (MDR) forms should be routinely collected using standard Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) tools. Complete and accurate identification of all deaths associated with pregnancy is a critical first step in the prevention of maternal deaths. Having a clear understanding of the magnitude and causes of pregnancy-associated mortality is key in formulating comprehensive strategies to prevent these unfortunate deaths among young and healthy women. We analyzed MDR data to understand the pattern of medical causes of maternal deaths and provide information that effectively guides actions to eliminate preventable mortality.</p></sec><sec id="st2-sub79"><title>Methods</title><p>We extracted data for the period 2009-2011from HMIS and MDR forms that were routinely submitted to the national data base (MOH Resource Centre) by health facilities within the national health system.

The factors analyzed include routine reporting and notification of maternal deaths, death by age, and pregnancy status at admission, antenatal attendance, parity, place of delivery, severity of illness, duration of stay in facility, referrals, HIV status and cause of death as reported on the review forms. Excel program was used to calculate descriptive statistics.</p></sec><sec id="st3-sub79"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 116 hospitals, only 22(19%) submitted MDR forms.

The five medical causes of death are hemorrhage (39%, n = 123), abortion (13%, 40 deaths), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (10%, n = 31), uterine rupture (8%, n = 26) and sepsis (8%, n = 26). About 3/4 of the deceased were aged below 30years (70%, n = 222), and 1/4 were teenagers, the youngest being 14 years. 32%(n = 101) died in labor and 25%(n = 79) were critically ill on admission. 51.4%(n = 162) of the deceased spent over 24hours in the facility before death.

Wild ruminants and carnivores are the natural reservoirs of the infection. Approximately 85% of cattle and 82% of the human population of Africa live in areas where Tb is partly controlled or neglected. In Ghana, a study conducted showed that out of 70 persons diagnosed with Tb, 3% was due to M. bovis.

However, the practice of not sub-typing the mycobacterium in affected persons makes it unclear if M. bovis is responsible for the infections in both cattle and humans in these communities. Health facilities in the region should be empowered by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to subtype all diagnosed Tb cases. Also, VSD should ensure collaboration between veterinary laboratories and field veterinarians for the confirmation of all suspected cases of BTB in the region. They should provide logistics to enhance clinical and postmortem diagnosis of the disease. As a result, clinical diagnostic kits were sent to the region and the first intra-dermal tuberculin testing carried out in cattle in many parts of the region.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub89"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Oral Presentations</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>Assessing Multi Drug Resistance Tuberculosis in Coast Province, Kenya 2009-2012</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>EL-Busaidy</surname><given-names>Hajara</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF0001-sub89">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF0001-sub89"><label>1</label>Kenya Field Epidemiology and Laboratory and Training Program</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date><abstract><sec id="st1-sub89"><title>Background</title><p>Kenya is one of the 22 high burden TB countries that collectively contribute about 80% of the world's TB burden.

This program provides services to health professionals with potential exposures to HIV in the workplace, and establishes the notification of exposure, initial medical care, and orientation of the HCW regarding follow-up and chemoprophylaxis. For each occupational exposure, a form is completed with data regarding work location and function, years of service, and past occupational accidents. Also noted on this form are the time, location and nature of the accident and information regarding the source patient, including their diagnosis and HIV status.

Any inadequacy in prevention and control of TB increases the chances of transmission. Tuberculosis Infection prevention and Control (IPC) measures are important in TB control. Emergence of drug resistant TB and high burden of TB/HIV AIDS in Kenya complicate the situation. The divisional of Leprosy TB and Lung disease (DLTLD) is scaling up IPC measures.

Those who tested HIV positive were referred to treatment and care facilities while those negative were educated on risk reduction behavior. Government and stakeholders need to scale up prevention and behavior al change and communication activities in-country.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article id="sub98"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Pan Afr Med J</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">PAMJ</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>The Pan African Medical Journal</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="epub">1937-8688</issn><publisher><publisher-name>The African Field Epidemiology Network</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Oral Presentations</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>The prevalence of HIV and the Associated Factors in the fishing communities in Mwanza region, Tanzania-2012</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kabamanya</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="AF0001-sub98">1</xref></contrib></contrib-group><aff id="AF0001-sub98"><label>1</label>Tanzania Field Epidemiology and Laboratory and Training Program</aff><pub-date pub-type="epub"><day>22</day><month>7</month><year>2015</year></pub-date><abstract><sec id="st1-sub98"><title>Background</title><p>Fishing communities have been identified among the vulnerable groups at high risk for acquiring HIV. This vulnerability is mainly due to their mobility, time away from home, access to cash income and commercial sex at landing sites. The nature of their work contributes to low health service seeking behavior since much of their time is spent in water. Studies done in Uganda, Kenya, Cambodia and other parts of the world among the fishing communities reported higher prevalence of HIV compared to the general population.

Angola has not recorded a poliomyelitis case since July 2011. To be certified free from poliomyelitis, a country has to report no case of the disease for three consecutive years and to have a high quality epidemiologic surveillance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surveillance system by assessing the attributes simplicity, sensitivity, and timeliness and to identify weakness on the system that may need to be reinforced.</p></sec><sec id="st2-sub130"><title>Methods</title><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted at all reference health units in Luanda where39 participants working in the health units were interviewed. Timeliness was evaluated using WHO recommended rates for timely and adequate stool sample collection. A table review was performed using a check list to evaluate the representativeness. We evaluated sensitivity using surveillance time period of one year, on the ability of the system to detect cases at a prevalence of 2 cases per 100 000 persons. The attribute simplicity was evaluated at two levels; from key informants and surveillance officers.</p></sec><sec id="st3-sub130"><title>Results</title><p>All key informants perceived the system difficult as it had five case definitions.

Ethiopia has been free of wild poliovirus since 2008 when it was imported into the Gambela region. Prior to that, it was imported from Somalia in 2006. The last case of indigenous wild poliovirus in Ethiopia occurred in 2001. We analyzed AFP surveillance data in Ethiopia from 2008-2012 to assess the immunization status of those reported cases, fulfillment of indicator criteria and the distribution and burden of wild and vaccine derived polioviruses.</p></sec><sec id="st2-sub138"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a descriptive cross sectional study on the national acute flaccid paralysis data from 2008 - 2012 in Ethiopia.

Two of the cases had taken 3 polio doses and one case had taken &#x0003c;3 polio doses of vaccine. There were 12(240/100,000) cases of vaccine derived polio virus of which five cases had taken &#x02265;3 doses of vaccine and seven cases took &#x0003c;3 doses of vaccine. There were 4733 discarded or negative cases and 65 cases were compatible with poliomyelitis after 60 days follow up. The proportion of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NP-AFP) cases with two stool specimens collected within 14 days of onset of paralysis was above 2/100.000 for all years and the stool adequacy rate was &#x02265;80% which fulfilled 2 important indicators.</p></sec><sec id="st4-sub138"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ethiopia has been free of indigenous polio virus since 2001 and free of imported polio virus since 2008.

Respondents were selected using the WHO cluster sampling technique. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on mothers&#x02019; knowledge about immunization and immunization status of their children aged 12 &#x02013; 23 months. A child was considered fully immunized if he has received a dose of Bacillus Calmette - Guerin (BCG), three doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), three doses of Diphtheria &#x02013; Pertussis &#x02013; Tetanus (DPT), three doses of Hepatitis B Vaccine (HBV), and a dose each of Measles and Yellow Fever vaccines by 12 months of age while a partially immunized child would have missed one or more of these doses.

Respondents with adequate knowledge were more likely to have their children fully immunized than those with inadequate knowledge (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.024- 2.67). Thirty percent of respondents with secondary education had their children fully immunized compared to 17.3% of the non-educated ones. Employed mothers were twice more likely to fully immunize their children than unemployed mothers (OR = 2.3, 95% CI= 1.4-3.8). Inconvenient immunization scheduling (14.4%), lack of social support (12.2%), lack of knowledge about need for additional doses (9.4%) and lack of vaccine (8.1%) were among the reasons for incomplete routine immunization coverage.</p></sec><sec id="st4-sub139"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Full immunization coverage among children aged 12-23 months old in the study area was below the national target of at least 80.0%.

The disease and can affect all warm- blooded vertebrates including man. Estimated annual global human mortalities from Rabies is 55,000, of which 31,000 and 24,000 are from Asia and Africa respectively where an estimated US$ 583.5 million is spent on its control. Rabies has become endemic in Ghana. We undertook an analysis of Rabies data in the Greater-Accra Region to determine the trend of human and animal Rabies, and assess percentage coverage of animal anti-Rabies vaccinations annually from 2007-2011.</p></sec><sec id="st2-sub140"><title>Methods</title><p>We reviewed vaccination data for all ten Districts in the region, interviewed staff of the regional Rabies desk, and abstracted data from post-mortem and quarantine records of the National Veterinary Laboratory. Further, we reviewed human Rabies records from the Fevers Unit of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital and the Regional Public Health Directorate. Data was entered and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. We calculated percentages, drew graphs and analyzed trends.</p></sec><sec id="st3-sub140"><title>Results</title><p>Of a total of 309 animal specimens tested during the period, 283/309 were positive for Rabies; predictive value positive being 91.6%.

The odds of a vaccinated animal testing positive for Rabies were about the same as that for animals with no previous vaccination history (&#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> =0.42, {Fishers exact test= 0.54}). Of the specimens submitted for testing, 174/319 (54.5%) were from animals which had bitten 324 humans, and 55/174 bit more than one person, whiles 64/324 (19.8%) victims were bitten by their own dogs. The mean number of human rabid deaths from 2008-2011 was five. Pet vaccinations in the region were lowest in 2010, at 439. Interestingly, the number of outbreaks was highest in the same year, at 34.</p></sec><sec id="st4-sub140"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The upsurge in Rabies outbreaks could be due to the absence of simultaneous mass vaccinations across districts.

The program aims to build applied epidemiology and laboratory capacity through joint training and field activities involving both epidemiology and laboratory trainees. Despite annual outbreaks of Cholera in Mozambique, laboratory capacity for Vibrio Cholera (Vc) testing remains limited to reference laboratories (RL) in the capital Maputo. For Cholera outbreaks occurring elsewhere, specimens must be packaged and transported to the RL.

While organizations continue to seek overall performance improvements, a key internal consideration is to determine if the leaders&#x02019; influence is felt by followers as to perform their duties based on the leader influence. The study sought to help leaders understand how their behavior affects the follower performance and helps the followers appreciate the characteristics of good leader behavior. Objectives: To identify the dimensions of leader behavior; determine the level of follower compliance to the leader; establish the linkage between leader behavior and follower performance; identify other determinants of follower performance. Research Questions: What are the dimensions of leader behavior? What is the level of follower compliance to the leader? What is the link between leader behavior and follower performance? What are other determinants of follower performance?</p></sec><sec id="st2-sub146"><title>Methods</title><p>A qualitative approach which involved focus group discussion (FGD) and survey interviews was conducted. 6 FGDs of 6 chosen hospital departments and 6 interview surveys were conducted with 6 heads of the chosen departments. A total of 60 respondents in FGDs and 6 leaders for interview surveys were considered. Purposive sampling was used because participants had an experience of the subject being investigated. Inclusion criterion was all followers in chosen departments and leaders of the same departments. Data from FGDs and interviews then captured on a recorder and then transcribed later onto paper.

The dimension of Work facilitation was not found. Followers easily followed instructions from leaders with democratic and engaging leader behavior since it had increase of follower readiness. Positional leader behavior led to low follower readiness thus poor follower compliance and poor performance. Engaging and democratic leader behavior showed high follower readiness thus great follower performance. Positional leader behavior led to low follower readiness thus poor follower performance.

To improve neonatal health, WHO and UNICEF recommend home visits to mothers and babies in the first week of life to assess for danger signs (sickness) and counsel caretakers for immediate referral of the sick. However, there is a dearth of data on the level of timely compliance and determinants of newborn referral in sub-Saharan Africa.
