the guidance says. </p><p>These preventive measures include mosquito bednets, including when sleeping during the daytime; mosquito mesh/nets/screens on windows and doors; insect repellents and clothes that cover as much of the body as possible. </p><p>To prevent potential sexual acquisition of Zika virus during pregnancy, the sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas of ongoing Zika virus transmission, should, for the duration of the pregnancy, use condoms or adhere to other safe sexual practices, including abstinence, the guidance says.</p><p>In addition, safe sex practices are recommended for people infected with Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus, including consistent and correct use of condoms, for at least four weeks after onset of symptoms to avoid further spread of these infections, the guidance says.</p><p>The guidance also provides advice on the diagnosis and care of pregnant women with Zika infection. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/pregnancy-management/">http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/pregnancy-management/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Psychosocial guidance and Zika</title><p>Health professionals should take a supportive approach when they diagnose women with Zika virus or attend to the families of babies with neonatal malformations, such as microcephaly, and neurological disorders in areas affected by Zika virus, according to interim WHO guidance.</p><p>The guidance is for health professionals attending to three groups: pregnant women with suspected or confirmed Zika virus infection; pregnant women who know they are carrying a child with suspected microcephaly; and the caregivers and families of an infant with microcephaly. </p><p>&#x0201c;The way a health-care provider assesses and manages these health conditions can have an impact on the psychosocial well-being of patients and their families&#x0201d;, the guidance says, stressing the importance of providing reliable information in a form that women and their partners understand and of asking them about their concerns. </p><p>This practical guidance also offers advice on stress management, strengthening social supports and parenting.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/psychosocial-support/">http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/psychosocial-support/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Zika research </title><p>WHO held a three-day consultation last month on the status of Zika clinical research, looking at ways to drive research and development on vaccines, medicines, vector control and diagnostics needed to respond to the Zika crisis. </p><p>Scientists and health decision-makers &#x02013;

</p><p>Since the document was first issued in 2014, many new drugs have been licensed for hepatitis C virus infection and some of them were included in the latest <italic>WHO Model list of essential medicines</italic> released last year. </p><p>The updated guidelines for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection reflect these changes and include new evidence-based recommendations. </p><p>&#x0201c;These medicines are transforming the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, enabling the use of regimens that can be administered orally, [that] are shorter in duration (as short as eight weeks), [and that] result in cure rates higher than 90%, and are associated with fewer serious adverse events,&#x0201d; according to the updated guidelines. </p><p>The updated guidelines no longer recommend treatment with first-generation protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, as these two medicines are less effective than newer medicines and have more frequent adverse effects. </p><p>The updated guidelines also offer recommendations on the preferred and alternative regimens based on a patient&#x02019;s hepatitis C virus genotype and clinical history, such as whether patients have cirrhosis or not. </p><p>About 500 000 persons die every year as a result of hepatitis C virus-related complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis of the liver. </p><p>Hepatitis C virus infection can be cured by antiviral treatment, but the new drugs are unaffordable in many countries. Fortunately, prices are declining in some countries through the introduction of generics and negotiated price reductions with manufacturers. </p><p>Despite the fact that prices are falling, &#x0201c;the scaling up of treatment is likely to remain restricted in many countries because of the continued high prices of medicines and lack of health-care infrastructure,&#x0201d; according to the updated guidelines. </p><p>Hepatitis C is a bloodborne virus most commonly transmitted through the use of shared or unsterilized injection equipment and through unscreened blood transfusions. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/hepatitis-c-guidelines-policy/">http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/hepatitis-c-guidelines-policy/</ext-link>
